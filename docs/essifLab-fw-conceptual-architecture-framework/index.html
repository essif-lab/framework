A high quality architecture description will be complete in its list of stakeholders (or stakeholder <a href="/framework/docs/terms/role" hovertext="Role (of an Entity in some context): a defined set of characteristics that the Entity has in some context, such as responsibilities (Obligations) it may have, Actions (behaviors) it may execute, or pieces of Knowledge that it is expected to have in that context, which are referenced to by a specific (Role-)name.">roles</a>) and their concerns. Also, it will have addressed each of them in one or more of its views.</p>
