### Short Description
A **decision** (of a %%party|party%%) is the conclusion that this %%party|party%% inferences from a set of %%data|data%% that it considers to be facts. The method of inferencing does not need to be mathematically sound (and more often than not, that is in fact the case). [Toulmin's model for reasoning](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/uses-of-argument/26CF801BC12004587B66778297D5567C) is a generic and useful model for explaining how decisions generally come to pass.

The (envisaged) %%decision-making model|pattern-decision-making%% elaborates further on this.

### Purpose
Making **decisions** is the very reason for having %%SSI|self-sovereign-identity%% technology, as the %%data|data%% in %%credentials|credential%% provide the facts that %%parties|party%% use to make them.

### Criteria
A **decision** (of a %%party|party%%) is the conclusion that a %%party|party%% inferences from a set of %%data|data%% that it considers to be facts.
