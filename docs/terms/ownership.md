### Short Description
**Ownership** is a relationship between two [entities](@) that exists within the [scope of control](@) of a [jurisdiction](@), in which one of them (called the [owner](@)) has legal, rightful or natural rights and/or duties to enjoy, dispose of, and control the other (called the [owned](@)).

The titles are specified by (the rules of) the [legal system](@) of the [jurisdiction](@), and the meaning of an ownership instance (i.e.: what you can(not) do with it) depend on the ways in which such rules are enforced, and disputes resolved. Obviously both the [owner](@) and the [owned](@) must be known (i.e.: be [legal entities](@)) in that [jurisdiction](@)).

We may use adjectives in combination with 'ownership' to signify the kind of [jurisdiction](@) within which that relationship exists. For example, 'legal ownership' signifies that the relationship exists in a [legal jurisdiction](@), and 'natural ownership' that it is in the [jurisdiction](@) called 'nature'. An example of natural ownership is any statement uttered or authored by (or on behalf of) a [party](@) (the [owner](@) of the statement), because [parties](@) have a natural right to express themselves.

### Purpose
**Ownership** is a means by which [jurisdictions](@) ensure that [owners](@) can autonomously enjoy, dispose of and control the [entities](@) that they [own](@) to the extent of the entitlements (rights and duties) as defined in the [jurisdiction's](@) [legal system](@), and within its [scope of control](@).

### Criteria
**Ownership** is a relationship between two [legal entities](@) (called the [owner](@) and the [owned](@)) within a single [jurisdiction](@), whose [legal system](@) (a) defines the rights and duties of the [owner](@) to enjoy, dispose of and control the [owned](@), (b) enforces them, and (c) provides a means to settle disputes.

### Notes

1. [Ownership](@) *only* has meaning within a [jurisdiction](@) that defines *and* enforces a set of rights and duties of the [owner](@) and/or the [owned](@). The value of [ownership](@) is typically proportional to the extent in which the [jurisdiction](@) enforces such rights and duties.

2. [Owning](@) something does not imply possessing it (and vice versa). For example, if you find a coin that doesn't belong to you, you possess it but do not [own](@) it. Also, its rightful [owner](@) obviously [owns](@) it, but doesn't possess it at that point in time. Still, a [jurisdiction](@) may have rules that create or dissolve [ownership](@) relationships depending on who possesses the [entity](@).

3. While [owners](@) are typically [parties](@), the model does not require this to be the case. Thus, if a [jurisdiction](@) decides that rivers own their respective banks, the model does not disapprove. But such rivers and their banks do need to qualify as [legal-entities](@) within said [jurisdiction](@).

4. The model does not set limitations on the kinds of [entities](@) that can be [owned](@), other than that they need to be known in the [jurisdiction(s)](@) that specify the rights and duties associated with [ownership](@) relationships.

### Examples

1. Many [legal jurisdictions](@) have legislation  (e.g. [property law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_law)) that states who owns what - houses, cars, etc.

2. In this [framework](@), we say that
  a. an [objective](@) that a particular [party](@) pursues (i.e. towards which a [party](@) directs effort), is [owned](@) by that [party](@), and the rights and duties associated with this [ownership](@) are defined by the [jurisdiction](@) that the [party](@) is itself.
  b. a [risk](@) that is associated with an [objective](@) is [owned](@) by the [owner](@) of that [objective](@), and the rights and duties
