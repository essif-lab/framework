### Short Description
A **scope-file** is a file that contains the specification of a specific [scope](@). To facilitate authors, a self-explanatory [template file](/tev1/scope-file.md) is available.

### Purpose
[Scopes](@) enable people to focus, which is important as people's short-term memory is limited to 7 +/- 2 concepts (with attributes) [(Miller, 1956)](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/). Hence, defining a scope - what is in it and what is not - is relevant as well.

### Criterion
a file that defines/specifies a [scope](@).
