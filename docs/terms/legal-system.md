### Short Description
A **Legal System** is a system in which rules are defined ([legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature)) and a mechanism for their enforcement is implicitly or explicitly defined ([executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government))), as well as a mechanism for conflict resolution ([judiciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary)). A legal system is designed and governed by a single [party](@). A legal system can be operationalized by assigning it a scope within which enforcement and conflict resolution are implemented. The associated operational tasks may be [mandated](@) or [delegated](@) to other [parties](@). Depending on the individual legal system, 'rules' may be called 'laws', 'regulations', 'directives', 'policies', 'working instructions', etc. Other terms exist for specializations of these terms, e.g. 'order', '[mandate](@)', and others.

The [Jurisdictions pattern](pattern-jurisdiction@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)legal-systems is a very generic enabler to tell which rules (laws, policies, guidelines, etc.) will apply within its [scope](@), as well as to evaluate the [risks](@) that we run when not complying with the rules. Conversely, the [party](@) that operates a legal system may provide additional rules to help mitigate such [risks](@).

### Criteria
A system in which rules are defined ([legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature)), can be enforced ([executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government))), and a mechanism is defined to resolve conflicts ([judiciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary)).

### Examples
- many nations have their own legal system (see e.g. [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_legal_systems))
- enterprises typically have at least one legal system, with policies or working instructions as their rules.
- multi-nationals, NGOs etc. typically have multiple legal systems that are to be operated in different [scopes](@) where such operations are subject to other, often [legal jurisdictions](@).
- all sorts of associations, societies, clubs, unions would qualify as a jurisdiction.
- families have a legal system, where the rules may or may not change regularly, enforcement may not always be consistent, and conflict resolution may be ad-hoc.
- individual people can be said to have a legal system of their own, containing e.g. rules for ethics and morals.
