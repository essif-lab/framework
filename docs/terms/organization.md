### Short Description
An **Organization** is a %%party|party%% that is associated with a group of %%actors|actor%% that work to realize its %%objectives|objective%%. Enterprises and governments are the prototypical examples. However, parts of enterprises (e.g. divisions, departments, business units) should also be considered organizations. This also holds for governments and governmental bodies.

### Purpose
The purpose of documenting this term is to provide additional clarity w.r.t. definitions given in english dictionaries. Also, we need this notion as it is used in the eSSIF-Lab %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%%.

### Criteria
A %%party|party%% that is associated with a (non-empty) group of %%actors|actor%% that work to realize its (non-empty set of) %%objectives|objective%%. This group of actors consists of actors that are %%owned|owner%% by that party as well as actors that are %%employees|employee%% of that party.

### Examples
- Enterprises and governments are the prototypical examples.
- Parts of enterprises (e.g. divisions, departments, business units) and governmental bodies also qualify.
- Individual persons satisfy the criteria and hence qualify (see the Notes below).

### Notes
One may question whether or not a single person can be a 'group of people' (who would obviously work to realize its personal objectives) and hence qualify as an organization. The answer to this question is however irrelevant within our context, because we reason with the concept %%party|party%% rather than the concepts organization and/or person.
