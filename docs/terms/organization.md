### Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
An **Organization** is a group of %%actors|actor%% that work to realize one or more objectives. Enterprises and governments are the prototypical examples. However, parts of enterprises (e.g. divisions, departments, business units) should also be considered organizations. This also holds for governments and governmental bodies.

### Purpose
<!--Describe why the concept is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this concept relevant within its scope of definition?-->
The purpose of documenting this term is to provide additional clarity w.r.t. definitions given in english dictionaries. Also, we need this notion as it is used in the eSSIF-Lab %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%%.

### Criteria
A (non-empty) group of people that work to realize a (non-empty) set of objectives.

### Examples
<!--Provide a few sentences in which you give examples that obviously qualify as instances of `<New Term>`, and that do NOT obviously qualify. Also, provide examples that are not (so) obvious, but help users to better understand its intension.-->
- Enterprises and governments are the prototypical examples.
- Parts of enterprises (e.g. divisions, departments, business units) and governmental bodies also qualify.
- Individual persons satisfy the criteria and hence qualify (see the Notes below). 

### Notes
<!--This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it.-->
- One may question whether or not a single person can be a 'group of people' (who would obviously work to realize its personal objectives) and hence qualify as an organization. The answer to this question is however irrelevant within our context, because we reason with the concept %%party|party%% rather than the concepts organization and/or person.
