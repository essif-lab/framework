### Short Description
A **risk owner** is the [party](@) that is the [owner](@) of the [objective](@) to which the [risk](@) is associated.

The [owner](@) of a [risk](@) that is associated with an [objective](@) must be the [party](@) that [owns](@) that [objective](@), and vice versa, because [ownership](@) implies the [authority](@) (rights and duties) to realize the [objective](@), which in turn implies the [authority](@) to [manage](@) the associated [risks](@). Of course, as all [owners](@) are [parties](@), a [risk owner](@) may [mandate](@) [actors](@) to execute the [actions](@) that are necessary to [manage](@) a [risk](@), but that does not relieve the [party](@) from its ownership (and facing possibly associated consequences). In fact, the objective of [mandating](@) [risk management](@) activities may come with [risks](@) which are often overlooked.

Networked Risk Management (reference needed) exploits the fact that the owner of a [risk](@) and the owner of the associated [objective](@) are one and the same [party](@), the fact that in [human beings](@) are often not aware of the [risks](@) they run, and the observation that important [risks](@) often manifest themselves in feelings of insecurity or anxiety/tension, abdominal pain, sleepless nights, or other types of physical discomfort (the degree of which can be seen as the associated [risk level](@)). Noticing that a [person](@) shows signals of physical discomfort can be used as a trigger for an [activity](@), the result of which is that the associated [objective](@) is identified (and made explicit), so that it can be analyzed, evaluated and treated (see [risk-management](@)).

### Purpose
Knowing who [owns](@) a [risk](@) is knowing who is accountable when something goes wrong. When the associated [objective](@) is also identified, the [risk](@) can subsequently be [managed](@).

### Formalization

In the context of the eSSIF-Lab [framework](@) (way of thinking), the definition can be explained by observing that there is an [ownership](@) relation between the [party](@) and the [risk](@) that is associated with any [objective](@) that it [owns](@). Determining that such a relation exists can be verified by applying its [definition](@), and observing that:
  - the [party](@) is a [jurisdiction](@) (as explained [here](@)),
  - both the [party](@) itself and the [risk](@) are known to that [party](@) and hence qualify as [legal entities](@) for that [jurisdiction](@);
  - [parties](@) (un)consciously create, maintain and enforce rules ([policies](@)) for identifying, assessing and treating uncertainties in (the effects of) their [objectives](@) - which are the [risks](@) associated with such [objectives](@), which is equivalent with saying that within their [jurisdiction](@), the [legal system](@) (a) defines their rights and duties "to enjoy, dispose of and control" these [risks](@), (b) enforces them - i.e. [manage](@) them, and (c) provides a means to settle disputes - i.e. determine which of the various ways to control or treat risks must be followed.
