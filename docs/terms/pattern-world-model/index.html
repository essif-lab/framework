<p>The <strong>eSSIF-Lab World Model</strong> consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>the set of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;)."></a>, as listed in the <a href="/framework/docs/essifLab-Glossary">Glossary</a>,</li>
<li>relations between these concepts, as explained in the various concept-descriptions, and in the various <a href="/framework/docs/terms/pattern" hovertext="Pattern (also: Mental Model): A description, both casual and formal, of a set of Concepts (ideas), relations between them, and constraints, that together form a coherent and consistent &#x27;viewpoint&#x27;, or &#x27;way of thinking&#x27; about a certain topic."></a>, as listed in the <a href="/framework/docs/essifLab-pattern-list">Patterns List</a>, and</li>
<li>a set of <a href="/framework/docs/essifLab-principles">Principles</a> that we take as starting points for our thinking.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="George E.P. Box: All models are wrong, but some are useful" src="/framework/images/essif-lab-all-models-are-wrong.png">
<p>We emphasize that the world model we propose is also &#x27;wrong&#x27; (in the sense of G. Box). However, we did make a serious effort for it to be useful: it is meant to serve as a sound basis for designing, implementing and deploying architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereignty" hovertext="Self-Sovereign(ty): the characteristic of every Party that it is autonomous in managing and operating its own Knowledge, particularly in making decisions and deciding how to decide."></a>) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples."></a> as they negotiate and execute electronic <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)."></a> with one another.</p>
<p>Our model contains several ways of thinking that may seem somewhat &#x27;alien&#x27;, in the sense that they do not appear to follow common thought patterns. Where you notice that, you will need to choose which way of thinking you want to follow. We suggest you temporarily suspend the common ways of thinking (you can always go back to your own ways of thinking), and give this &#x27;alien&#x27; eSSIF-Lab way of thinking a serious try. By &#x27;serious&#x27; we mean that you make an effort to actually understand what we&#x27;re trying to say and do. We certainly made an effort to make this as easy as we could, e.g. by being very precise in our definitions, and changing texts according to what we have heard people say.</p>
<p>Here, we only introduce/summarize the most fundamental concepts (and their properties) of the eSSIF-Lab world model. You are encouraged to browse on, clicking on the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/term" hovertext="Term: a word or phrase (i.e.: text) that is used in at least one Scope/context to represent a specific Concept."></a> you want to know more about, or reading up on the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/pattern" hovertext="Pattern (also: Mental Model): A description, both casual and formal, of a set of Concepts (ideas), relations between them, and constraints, that together form a coherent and consistent &#x27;viewpoint&#x27;, or &#x27;way of thinking&#x27; about a certain topic."></a> that provide the coherence between them.</p>

<p>eSSIF-Lab sees the world (universe) as being filled with <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist."></a>, i.e. things (people and animals included) that exist. Our world view is shaped by the distinctions that eSSIF-Lab makes as it classifies such entities into well-defined categories, each of which having specific characteristics.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="parties-entities-that-manage-and-use-a-knowledge-autonomously">Parties: Entities that manage and use a Knowledge autonomously<a href="#parties-entities-that-manage-and-use-a-knowledge-autonomously" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Parties: Entities that manage and use a Knowledge autonomously" title="Direct link to Parties: Entities that manage and use a Knowledge autonomously">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the most fundamental of such categories is called <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples."></a>. A party is defined as an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist."></a> that manages and uses its own <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party."></a> autonomously. It is its own sovereign, i.e. within its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/scope-of-control" hovertext="Scope of Control (of a Party): the extent of the area or subject matter that the Party controls."></a>, everything is guided by its own, subjective <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party."></a>. This includes all decision making, execution of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/action" hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context."></a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk" hovertext="Risk (of a Party&#x27;s Objective): the effects that uncertainty (i.e. a lack of information, understanding or knowledge of events, their consequences or likelihoods) can have on the intended realization of that Party&#x27;s Objective."></a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for."></a>, etc., etc. Typical examples include <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization" hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives."></a> (governments, enterprises) and individual human beings. Note that while <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p>We postulate that every party has <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action)."></a> that it pursues. A large part of its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party."></a> revolves about <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for."></a> and/or <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management" hovertext="Management: the act or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives."></a> these <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action)."></a> (which includes <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management" hovertext="Risk management: a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific Party for the purpose of Managing the Risks that it Owns (thereby realizing specific Risk Objectives)."></a>) and making sure they get realized.</p>

Humans and Organizations are the typical examples."></a> are their own (self-)sovereigns and in principle can do as they please, they live in a universe with many other parties, that are also &#x27;self-sovereigns&#x27;. This means that they need to come to terms with one another as they have interactions with one another that may influence the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party."></a> of the participating parties, and have other consequences as well. Such <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)."></a> between parties is not only one of the focal points of this framework: it is the reason we created it.</p>

<p>Another fundamental category is called <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations."></a>, which is defined as an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist."></a> that can act (do things). It is important to note that while some entity classes (e.g. human beings) qualify as both <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations."></a> and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

As an actor does something (executing an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/action" hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context."></a>), it uses the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party."></a> of one specific <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

We say that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations."></a> is executing that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/action" hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context."></a> on behalf of that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

Humans and Organizations are the typical examples."></a>. It is a particular contribution of this <a href="/framework/docs/terms/framework" hovertext="Framework (Conceptual): A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality."></a> that using it allows one to determine which <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations."></a> executes what <a href="/framework/docs/terms/action" hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context."></a> on behalf of what <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p>We follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_%26_Engineering_Methodology_for_Organizations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>DEMO</em></a> transactions pattern, which divides <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)."></a> in three phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>negotiation phase</strong>, in which one or more (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor)."></a> of each) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/participant" hovertext="Participant (in/of a Transaction): a Party is negotiating (or has negotiated) a Transaction Agreement."></a> exchange data for the purpose of establishing a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction-agreement" hovertext="Transaction Agreement (for a specific Business Transaction): the set of rules that specify the rights (Expectations) and duties (Obligations) of Participants towards one another in the context of a specific Business Transaction."></a> that specifies what the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)."></a> entails. This phase results either in a commitment decision of all <a href="/framework/docs/terms/participant" hovertext="Participant (in/of a Transaction): a Party is negotiating (or has negotiated) a Transaction Agreement."></a>, or the termination of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)."></a> because one of them quits.</li>
<li>an <strong>execution phase</strong>, in which (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor)."></a> of) the same principals work (execute actions) to fulfill the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/obligation" hovertext="Obligation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for producing a specific (set of) result(s) that are to be used (consumed) by that Party and/or other Parties."></a> of the agreement. This phase results in them stating that they have completed that work (or that they gave up).</li>
<li>the <strong>acceptance phase</strong>, in which one or more (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor)."></a> of the) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/participant" hovertext="Participant (in/of a Transaction): a Party is negotiating (or has negotiated) a Transaction Agreement."></a> exchange data that leads to a decision to accept the results, or to escalate (e.g. start a lawsuit against the other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/participant" hovertext="Participant (in/of a Transaction): a Party is negotiating (or has negotiated) a Transaction Agreement."></a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The relevance of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereign-identity" hovertext="Self-Sovereign Identity (or SSI): a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) Parties as they negotiate and execute electronic Transactions with one another."></a> shows e.g. in the negotiation phase, where <a href="/framework/docs/terms/participant" hovertext="Participant (in/of a Transaction): a Party is negotiating (or has negotiated) a Transaction Agreement."></a> request and collect data that they need in order to make the commitment decision. In the eSSIF-Lab way of thinking, each <a href="/framework/docs/terms/participant" hovertext="Participant (in/of a Transaction): a Party is negotiating (or has negotiated) a Transaction Agreement."></a> will collect data to serve any of the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to know what each of the participants (including itself) will commit itself to produce/deliver/...;</li>
<li>to ensure that the value of what the participant gets exceeds the value of what it produces/delivers/...;</li>
<li>to ensure that the magnitude of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk" hovertext="Risk (of a Party&#x27;s Objective): the effects that uncertainty (i.e. a lack of information, understanding or knowledge of events, their consequences or likelihoods) can have on the intended realization of that Party&#x27;s Objective."></a> it perceives to run upon committing to the transaction, remain at an acceptable level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every participant is assumed to be autonomous, which means that the assessment of the value of what it gets/produces is subjective, and so is the perception of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk" hovertext="Risk (of a Party&#x27;s Objective): the effects that uncertainty (i.e. a lack of information, understanding or knowledge of events, their consequences or likelihoods) can have on the intended realization of that Party&#x27;s Objective."></a>, and the assessment of their magnitude. Hence, the need for specific kinds of data and associated assurances, all of which can be provided through <a href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereign-identity" hovertext="Self-Sovereign Identity (or SSI): a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) Parties as they negotiate and execute electronic Transactions with one another."></a> technologies, are quite subjective. It is part of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for."></a> of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples."></a> to define their information needs for specific kinds of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)."></a>, which is expected to lead to the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/policy" hovertext="Policy: a (set of) rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance for the execution of one or more kinds of Actions, that Agents of the Party that Governs the policy have access to and can interpret such that this results in these Actions being executed as intended by that Party."></a> that provide the primary guidance that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations."></a> (people as well as systems) need to conduct such <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)."></a> on their behalf.
