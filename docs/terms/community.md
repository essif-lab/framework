### Short Description
A **Community** is a [party](@), consisting of at least two different [parties](@) (the members of the [community](@)) that seek to collaborate with each other so that each of them can achieve its individual [objectives](@) more efficiently and/or effectively. As a [party](@), the community sets its own [objectives](@) that its members contribute to realizing, because the results thereof aim to facilitate their cooperation.

There is no fundamental difference between [communities](@) and other [parties](@) in the sense that they are all [parties](@) that set [objectives](@) and [produce](@) and/or [consume](@) associated results. However, the kind of [objectives](@) of a [community](@) is expected to serve the cooperation of its members, facilitate their collaborations, and remove any obstacles thereto. A [community](@) serves its members as they seek to realize their individual [objectives](@).

Note however that this 'serving' implies that each of its members sufficiently contributes to the realization of the communities' [objectives](@). This may be at odds with that member realizing its own [objectives](@). A [community](@) would do well
- to have [objectives](@) in place that support its members in handling such balancing acts,
- realize that its members are [parties](@), i.e. are autonomous entities that the [community](@) cannot control, and from there
- [manage the risks](@) of (some of) its members not contributing their share of the work.

Note that a single set of [parties](@) can constitute different communities, the difference becoming apparent in the different [objectives](@) that the communities pursue, or by the fact that individual [parties](@) may join or leave one, but not the other community.

A community is a specialization of the more generic [ecosystem](@) in the sense that it is a [party](@) in its own right (which an ecosystem need not be), and it (actively) facilitates the cooperation between its members, whereas in non-community ecosystems, such cooperation is not actively planned or organized.

### Purpose
The purpose of having [communities](@) is to organize and optimize collaborations between [parties](@) that reduce their individual effort for realizing their individual [objectives](@) to a greater extent than the effort they must put into contributing to the community.

### Criterion
A **Community[ is a %%party](@),
- that consists of at least two different [parties](@) (its members);
- that sets [objectives](@) for realizing results that enable its members to achieve their individual [objectives](@) more efficiently and/or effectively;
- whose members contribute to the realization of these [objectives](@).
