### Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
A **Legal Entity** is an %%entity|entity%% that is known by and recognized to exist in a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%. For %%legal jurisdictions|legal-jurisdiction%%, this usually means that the entity is registered. Legal jurisdictions usually have a registration for its citizens, foreigners, enterprises, felonies, etc. Non-legal jurisdictions (e.g. a soccer club) register their members, donators, staff, properties, etc., either on the record, or off the record.

The %%Jurisdictions pattern|pattern-jurisdiction%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose
It is important to recognize that the term 'legal entity' does not refer to something that has an existence of its own, but that it is a property of en %%entity|entity%% that is linked to a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%. This enables us to query for the applicable jurisdiction when someone uses the term, and get the right understanding of what (s)he means.

### Criteria
A **Legal Entity** is an %%entity|entity%% that is known by and recognized to exist in a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% (i.e. registered in the %%knowledge|knowledge%% of the %%party|party%% that operates the %%legal system|legal-system%% of said jurisdiction).

### Examples
- citizens (organizations, etc.) that are registered in the citizens registration of some government, are legal entities in its jurisdiction.
- a refugee that is screaming before a civil servant person (i.e. (s)he is alive and kicking, and really exists), yet is not registered in the governmental administration, does not exist for that administration, i.e. is not a legal entity in that jurisdiction.
- whether or not some special stone qualifies as legal entity depends on whether or not it is known to exist in some jurisdiction.

### Notes
A legal entity does not necessarily have an existence outside of its %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%. For example, the rules of many legal jurisdictions specify criteria for entities to have their own legal rights and %%obligations|obligation%% - being a 'legal person' albeit not a human being (which is then called a 'natural person'). A 'limited liability partnership' or an 'incorporated entity' are examples of such constructs (for specific jurisdictions).
