Within the context of a [(business) transaction](@), at least two [parties](@) participate. From the perspective of any such [party](@), we need the ability to refer to (any of) the other [party](@)/parties.

### Notes
The term 'peer [party](@)' is specifically used in the context of a (business) transaction.
