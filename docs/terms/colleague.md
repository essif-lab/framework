### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non) colleagues allows us to reason and communicate about the set of (digital and non-digital) %%actors|actor%% that are %%agents|agent%% for a **principal|principal%%. This is relevant in situations where different %%agents|agent%% excute %%actions|action%% in a single %%business transaction|transaction%% on behalf of the same %%principal|principal%%
