### Short Description
A **compliance-objective** is an [objective](@), owned by a [party](@), that aims to reach and maintain a state of affairs in which a specific set of [entities](@) that this [party](@) controls are in accordance with a specific set of requirements (e.g., laws, regulations, standards, etc.). A [party](@) that has compliance objectives will have a [management](@) process that aims to realize these [objectives](@), for the purpose of becoming [compliant](@).

A [party](@) may decide to pursue compliance objectives that pertain to itself, e.g. to ensure it has good quality [management](@) (compliance with the ISO 9001 standard) or information security management (ISO 27001) in place. Or that it conforms to regulations such as PSD2 (for financial [organizations](@)), or GDPR.

A [party](@) may also decide to pursue compliance objectives that pertain to specific classes of [entities](@) such as information (or other) processes, various kinds of equipment, or other resource classes, e.g. to ensure quality, safety etc. The compliance objective should then also specify the appropriate normative framework(s), e.g. specifications, regulations, etc., that elements of such classes are expected to comply with.

Compliance objectives should also be associated with [assessment frameworks](@) that auditors will use for determining the [compliance-levels](@) for each of these objectives.

### Purpose
The purpose of compliance-objectives is help [parties](@) determine and prioritize the work they need to do in order to become [compliant](@).

### Criteria
A [compliance-objective](@) is an [objective](@) that
- is associated with one or more (classes of) [entities](@) that are controlled by the [owner](@) of the [objective](@);
- is associated with one or more [normative frameworks](@) that these (classes of) [entities](@) are to comply with;
- may be associated with appropriate [assessment frameworks](@) that auditors must use to determine the [level of compliance](@).
