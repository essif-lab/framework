hoverText: "The Decision Making pattern captures the Concepts and relations that explain how Parties would, could, or should reason in order to reach good conclusions and make good decisions. This can be used as a basis for understanding the information needs of Parties as they need to decide e.g. whether or not to commit to a Transaction proposal, or whether or not data is Valid for some purpose. This pattern is based on Toulmin's use of arguments."

### Purpose
The **Decision making pattern** captures the %%concepts|concept%% and relations that explain how %%parties|party%% would, could, or should reason in order to reach good conclusions and make good decisions. This can be used as a basis for understanding the information needs of  %%parties|party%% as they need to decide e.g. whether or not to commit to a %%transaction|transaction%% proposal, or whether or not data is %%valid|validate%% for some purpose. This pattern is based on [Toulmin's use of arguments](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/uses-of-argument/26CF801BC12004587B66778297D5567C) (of which a pragmatical text can be found [here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/historical_perspectives_on_argumentation/toulmin_argument.html)).

The relevance of this pattern is that it provides some basic ideas of the purposes which %%parties|party%% can feel they need information for in order to make good decisions.

### Introduction
<!-- Gently introduce the pattern, by referring to real-world situations and using colloquial terms, so that when someone has read the text, (s)he knows what it is about, and is ready to delve into the specifics of the pattern. -->

### Formalized model
Here is a visual representation of this pattern, using the following **[notations and conventions](../notations-and-conventions#pattern-diagram-notations)**:
