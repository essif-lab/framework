### Short Description
A **terminology** is a set of words and phrases (%%terms|term%%) that are used for reasoning and communicating about some specific topic(s). It is about choosing which words and/or phrases to use to refer to specific %%concepts|concept%% (nomenclature, or name-giving). A terminology may be viewed as a topic-specific subset of a %%vocabulary|vocabulary%%. A %%glossary|glossary%% may serve to document a terminology, providing short descriptions of each of its elements.

### Purpose
In order for people to properly reason and/or communicate ideas (%%concepts|concept%%) about some topic - in particular when it is a specialist topic - they have to establish a set of terms, the meaning of which is shared between them. Hence, we should be able to refer to such a set of terms, which we do using the term: `**terminology**`

### Criteria
A **terminology** is a set of %%terms|term%% that are used by a group of %%parties|party%% to reason and communicate about some specific topic(s).

### Examples
- The set of words listed in the [eSSIF-Lab glossary](../essifLab-glossary) are used within the eSSIF-Lab community for reasoning and communicating about topics that serve the [vision and purpose](../vision-and-purpose) of the [eSSIF-Lab project](https://essif-lab.eu/). This constitutes the `eSSIF-Lab terminology`.
- The set of words listed in the [Sovrin glossary](https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/) are used within the Sovrin Governance Framework and its Controlled Documents to understand the meaning of the terms that the authors intended to convey. Thus they comprise the `Sovrin terminology`.
