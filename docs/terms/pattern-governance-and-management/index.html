<p>The <strong>Governance and Management pattern</strong> captures the concepts and relations that explain how <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> organize that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">their</a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objectives</a> are realized, either by doing the associated work themselves (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/management" hovertext="Management: the act or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives.">management</a>), or by arranging for other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> to do that (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for.">governance</a>). The contribution of this pattern is to show how this is done, based on the idea that every <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> is <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owned" hovertext="Owned (by an Owner, in some Jurisdiction): an Entity over which another Entity (its Owner) has the power (duty, right) to enjoy it, dispose of it and control it; that power is limited to (the scope of) that Jurisdiction, and by its rules.">owned</a> by a single <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p>Whether or not an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> is realized can be seen by the status of the associated results, as is explained <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective">there</a>. The following figure is a recap of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a>-concept (using the usual <strong><a href="/framework/docs/notations-and-conventions#pattern-diagram-notations">notations and conventions</a></strong>):</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="A Party&#x27;s Objectives" src="/framework/images/essif-lab-objective.png"><i>Figure 1. Parties and their objectives.</i></p>
<p>The core property of this model is that every <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> has precisely one <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owner</a>, which is the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> that pursues the realization of the associated results, from one (or both) of the two following perspectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the <em><strong>production</strong></em>, <em><strong>supply</strong></em>, or <em><strong><a href="/framework/docs/terms/management" hovertext="Management: the act or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives.">management</a></strong></em> perspective. This is the perspective in which the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owner</a> of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> will itself be <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management" hovertext="Management: the act or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives.">managing</a> the creation (or maintenance) of the results associated with the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a>.

We assume that each party <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owns</a> multiple <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objectives</a>, but in the figure we only show a single one, each of which with a description that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/identify" hovertext="Identify: an Act, by or on behalf of a Party, that results in the selection of either (a) a single Partial identity that the party Owns, given some (observed or received) data, or (b) a single Entity from a given set of entities that is the Subject of a specified Partial identity that the party Owns.">identifies</a> that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> from the set of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objectives</a> of each <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p>The essence of this figure is to show that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> that produce a result have a matching issue.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the consuming party, the result produced by a producing party must qualify as a result that it needs. <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for.">Governing</a> an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> is basically specifying a result in such a way that it is fit for purpose, i.e. realizes the objective, AND finding a result that is produced by some <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> that qualifies as such, and that it can obtain. For Red (and Yellow) this means that they need to determine whether or not the results that Blue and Green produce qualify, and engage with either if that is the case. If not, they must either find other producers whose results do match, or they have to find an alternative result for realizing their objectives.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the producing party, producing a result is only meaningful if it is actually used. <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management" hovertext="Management: the act or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives.">Managing</a> an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> is basically producing a result in such a way that there is (at least) one party that needs it. This is not only about producing things, but also about finding out what makes the produced result fit for the (various) purposes of (potential) consuming parties.</p>

<p>Matching (of (the results of) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objectives</a>) is the process in which a producer and consumer interact to establish whether or not a produced result (of the producing party) qualifies as a consumable result (of the consuming party). In other words, matching is the process in which an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/expectation" hovertext="Expectation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for having a specific (set of) result(s) produced, where the actual production thereof is (going to be) outsourced to another Party.">expectation</a> of one <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p>This matching process can take many different forms, which can readily be observed in practice. A very simple example is where a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> (the consumer) has an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> to get a loaf of bread, which he decides to obtain from a baker. Thus, he needs to find a baker that he <a href="/framework/docs/terms/expectation" hovertext="Expectation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for having a specific (set of) result(s) produced, where the actual production thereof is (going to be) outsourced to another Party.">expects</a> to produce the bread, and communicate this <a href="/framework/docs/terms/expectation" hovertext="Expectation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for having a specific (set of) result(s) produced, where the actual production thereof is (going to be) outsourced to another Party.">expectation</a> (preferably with the fit-for-purpose criteria), so that the baker can determine whether or not &#x27;oblige&#x27;, which can either be the creation of a new <a href="/framework/docs/terms/obligation" hovertext="Obligation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for producing a specific (set of) result(s) that are to be used (consumed) by that Party and/or other Parties.">obligation</a> (e.g. in case it is very special bread that he doesn&#x27;t normally produce) that matches the consumer&#x27;s <a href="/framework/docs/terms/expectation" hovertext="Expectation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for having a specific (set of) result(s) produced, where the actual production thereof is (going to be) outsourced to another Party.">expectation</a>, or it can be the choosing of an existing <a href="/framework/docs/terms/obligation" hovertext="Obligation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for producing a specific (set of) result(s) that are to be used (consumed) by that Party and/or other Parties.">obligation</a> that they both agree aligns sufficiently well with that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/expectation" hovertext="Expectation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for having a specific (set of) result(s) produced, where the actual production thereof is (going to be) outsourced to another Party.">expectation</a>. Either way, the consumer and the baker now have an aligned pair of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objectives</a>, one being an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/expectation" hovertext="Expectation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for having a specific (set of) result(s) produced, where the actual production thereof is (going to be) outsourced to another Party.">expectation</a> (of the consumer towards the baker) and another being an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/obligation" hovertext="Obligation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for producing a specific (set of) result(s) that are to be used (consumed) by that Party and/or other Parties.">obligation</a> (of the baker towards the consumer).</p>

is the essence of the matching process.
