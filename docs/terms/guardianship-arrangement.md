### Short Description
A **Guardianship Arrangement** is the specification of a set of rights and duties between [legal entities](legal-entity@) of the [jurisdiction](@) that enforces these rights and duties, for the purpose of caring for and/or protecting/guarding/defending one or more of these [entities](legal-entity@). The entity that is being cared for may generically be referred to as the [dependent](@) under the guardianship arrangement. The entities that exercise the rights and duties for the actual caring of the dependent are generically referred to as [guardians](@).

The rules that govern the creation, updating and deletion of guardianship arrangements belong to the [legal system](@) of a specific [jurisdiction](@). This jurisdiction also defines the [guardianship type](@) that an arrangement is an instance (example) of, i.e. the roles of the dependent and guardians. In the end, the meaning (effectiveness, impact) that a guardianship arrangement has depends on jurisdiction, i.e. on the way the specified rights and duties can be enforced, and disputes settled. Note that this implies that all entities mentioned in a guardianship arrangement must be [legal entities](legal-entity@) of that jurisdiction.

The [Guardianship pattern](pattern-guardianship@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
The [Jurisdiction pattern](pattern-jurisdiction@) provides backgrounds on jurisdictions and how they function.

### Purpose
**Guardianship Arrangement** is a means that a [jurisdiction](@) can use to realize its [objectives](@) that pertain to the caring for, protecting, guarding, defending of [entities](@) that it finds to be in need thereof. The [legal system](@) of the [jurisdiction](@) specifies [guardianship types](guardianship-type@), sets of rights and duties of [guardians](@) and [dependents](@), etc., all of which are enforced by the jurisdiction by the extent it finds appropriate.

### Criteria
A **Guardianship Arrangement** (in a [jurisdiction](@)) is an assembly of
1. a collection of [legal entities](legal-entity@) within that jurisdiction, that have been assigned a (stakeholder-)role that are typically defined in the [guardianship type](@) that is defined by that jurisdiction and of which the arrangement is an instance;
2. a collection of duties and rights that are assigned to these legal entities, which they can enforce within the scope of that jurisdiction;

### Notes
- dependents need not always be people that are somehow very needy. The [manager](management@) of a department in a company may be tasked to care for the wellbeing of the workers in his department, which doesn't require such workers to be incapable of doing that for themselves.
- dependents need not always be people. Enterprises can have curators that care for an enterprise that has trouble to continue its existence. A historical heritage site might also become a dependent in a specific kind of guardianship type. Even some kinds of [ownership](@) may qualify as a guardianship, which is the case when the rights and duties that the [owner](@) has to enjoy, dispose of, and control the ([owned](@)) entity also serve to care for, or defend that entity.
- We may use the phrase [natural guardianship](guardianship-arrangement@) to refer to a 'guardianship arrangement' that exists in the [jurisdiction](@) 'Nature' (see the notes of [jurisdiction](@)). This enables us to talk about things as 'the (natural) guardianship of an [assertion](@)'.
