:::info Editor's note
This is work that is being envisaged
:::

The idea here is to observe that:
- mandating and delegating are the same except for the transfer of accountability for the transferred actions;
- the differences with guardianship seems to be not all that big, so we may see a merge with that model;
- ownership (as defined in the party-actor-action model) can possibly be made part of this, too.
