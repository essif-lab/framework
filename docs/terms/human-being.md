### Short Description
A **Human Being** is a person of flesh and blood (homo sapiens), each of which qualifies as:
- a %%party|party%%, because it sets its %%objectives|objective%%, maintains its %%knowledge|knowledge%%, and uses that %%knowledge|knowledge%% to pursue its %%objectives|objective%% in an autonomous (sovereign) manner;
- an %%actor|actor%%, as it is an %%entity|entity%% that can act (do things);
- a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%, as it has a (non-empty) set of %%objectives|objective%%, one %%scope|scope%% (i.e. its %%own|ownership%% body and %%knowledge|knowledge%%), one %%legal system|legal-system%% (i.e. the moral and ethical rules it has adopted for guiding its behaviour) and one %%party|party%% (i.e. itself) that operates this %%legal system|legal-system%% within itself.

In our %%framework|framework%%, we assume that %%humans|human-being%% %%own|owner%% themselves (especially in their personal %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%). However, we recognize that whether or not a %%person|human-being%% decides to %%own|owner%% itself lies in the autonomy of that %%person|human-being%%. So it may happen that a %%person|human-being%% chooses to (willingly or forced) relinquish this %%ownership|ownership%% to another %%party|party%% (which one might call 'slavery').

### Purpose
The purpose of of defining the human being is that it allows us to document that it also qualifies as a %%party|party%%, an %%actor|actor%% and a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%.

### Criteria
A **Human Being** is a person of flesh and blood (homo sapiens).

### Notes
Various contexts have related notions:
- **natural person** is a human being that - in a legal sense - holds rights and duties, and that can sue and be sued.
- **legal person** is a non-human %%entity|entity%% that - in a legal sense - holds rights and duties, that can sue and be sued, and hence (legally) treated in a similar fashion as a natural person.
