### Short Description
**Governance** is the [act](@) or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of [objectives](@) that are [owned](@) by a single [party](@), in order to ensure these results will be fit for the purposes that this [party](@) intends to use them for. This act or process is conducted by ([agents](@) that do so on behalf of) this [party](@).

Governance is about planning the budgets and other resources necessary  _to (obtain and to) actually use the results_. This includes the specification of timelines (deadlines) for the results to become available, as well as the properties and other characteristics (security, quality, sustainability, etc.) that results must have in order to make them effective ('fit for purpose' - fit to be used as intended by the consuming [party](@)). In order to keep tabs on the fitness of the results for the intended purposes, effectiveness indicators may be developed, i.e. gauges that measure how 'fit' the results are to be used/consumed for the intended purposes, are also part of this [governance](@).

The governance of a set of [objectives](@) can be implemented as a [control process](@) where each of these objectives serves as a control objective in that process.

We make a clear distinction between governance and [management](@), which is explained in the [governance and management pattern](pattern-governance-and-management@).
### Purpose
The purpose for a [party](@) of having a **governance** process is that it enables him to oversee the realization of (the results associated with) various subset of its [objectives](@), and to change the specification of the associated results, to select the appropriate [party](@) for actually realizing these results, etc.
