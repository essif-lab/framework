Control objectives are <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">objectives</span></a> that a party sets to be in control of something. A party that wants to control the quality of its processes, or the information security, may create a set of objectives the realization of which signify its being &#x27;in control&#x27; on such topics.</p><p>As with all <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">objectives</span></a>, control objectives are associated with results, which are to be produced, and used. It is typical for control objectives that their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">owner</span></a> actually uses (consumes) the results, implying that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">owner</span></a> will do their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance"><span style="font-weight:bold">governance</span></a>. The <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">owner</span></a> may do their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management"><span style="font-weight:bold">management</span></a> as well, or outsource it. See the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/pattern-governance-and-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">governance and management pattern</span></a> for an elaboration on this.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="control-process"></a>Control Process<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#control-process" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The control process we describe here is &#x27;effect-driven&#x27;, which means that it does not require any knowledge about the way in which the control objectives are realized. This means that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">parties</span></a> are not forced to use particular methods, procedures, etc. It specicially also allows the process to be used in a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance"><span style="font-weight:bold">governance</span></a> setting.</p><p>While some may see this process simply as a means to turn the PDCA-cycle (which in a way, it is), its value lies in the explicit specification of the concrete results that have to be achieved in the various steps. Such explicit specifications provide the concrete basis for both the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management"><span style="font-weight:bold">managers</span></a> of an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">objective</span></a> and its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance"><span style="font-weight:bold">governors</span></a> to do their jobs.</p><p>The executive summary of this process is that:</p><ol><li>(initial) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">control objectives</span></a> are set in terms of the results/effects that have to be achieved;</li><li>results/effects are measured through so-called &#x27;effect indicators&#x27;. (An indicator is a number or value that can be decided on (or measured) objectively by following a measuring instruction. An effect indicator measures an effect or result that is the aim of an organization. Example: &#x27;the percentage of deliveries of the last 30 days, that have been received by the customer within 24 hours after his order was accepted.&#x27;);</li><li>results/effects are judged not only on whether or not the effect indicators have met the applicable norms, but also on any circumstances (increasing insights, unexpected events, etc.) that have influenced such results. (A norm is a level that the organization aims an indicator to comply with or must reach. Example: [indicator] &gt; 99%.);</li><li>results are reflected upon, learning from what happened and/or celebrating the results;</li><li>decisions are made about altering the control objectives, indicators, judgements, etc. – if necessary.
The <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent"><span style="font-weight:bold">agent</span></a> (of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a> that owns this process) that is tasked with taking the decisions in this process is referred to as &#x27;the governor&#x27;. This means that the production of any result other than decisions may be delegated to other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor"><span style="font-weight:bold">actors</span></a>.
After step 5 is completed, the same conditions apply as after step 1 is completed, so execution continues at step 2 rather than step 1.</li></ol><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="1-setting-of-initial-control-objectives"></a>1.

In order to guarantee this distinction, it may be necessary to have third parties execute this activity.</p><p>The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:</p><ol><li>all effect indicators as specified in step 1 have been assigned a value.</li></ol><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="3-judging-resultseffects"></a>3.

The first is comparing the values of the (measured) effect indicators to the norms set in step 1.3. The second source is any progressing insights, unexpected events or other circumstances that might explain any deviations (both positive and negative) from the norms. It is explicitly part of this activity to identify such circumstances.</p><p>Taking both sources of information into account, judgement must be passed on each control objective; this judgement says whether or not the expected result/effect has been (sufficiently) achieved. A judgement should be justified if its indicator values deviate significantly from the norm (which can go both ways).</p><p>The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:</p><ol><li>for every control objective, it is clear whether or not its norm(s) have been satisfied;</li><li>for every control objective, there is a judgement stating whether or not it is (sufficiently) achieved;</li><li>if, for some control objective, the judgement differs from what would be expected given the evaluation of the norms, there is a justification for this judgement.</li></ol><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="4-reflectionlearning"></a>4. Reflection/Learning.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#4-reflectionlearning" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><em>The purpose of this <a href="/framework/docs/terms/action"><span style="font-weight:bold">activity</span></a> is to provide clarity about the next steps that should be taken.</em></p><p>Quite some time may elapse between setting control objectives, the associated effect indicators/norms, and judging the results/effects. Meanwhile, all sorts of things can change (e.g. laws, the market, political situation, competitors, technology, the organization&#x27;s obligations, etc.). Such changes may cause control objectives, effect indicators or norms to become outdated. The experience of having judged the results/effects in the previous step is invaluable, because the person that has done this will have &#x27;felt&#x27; any contradiction or discrepancy between the effect indicator values and norms, and his own sense of whether the results/effects have been achieved. This information and feeling allows the governor (and others) to ponder, e.g. about:
–  fine-tuning or modifying control objectives, indicators, norms;
–  modifying objectives that the organization has committed itself to realize (obligations);
–  possibilities for influencing circumstances/stakeholders;
–  celebrating (unexpectedly) well achieved objectives.</p><p>The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:</p><ol><li>for every control objective it has been established what should be modified/improved and/or celebrated;</li><li>for every control objective there is a proposition of how this may be achieved;</li><li>there is either a proposition for new control objectives, each of which satisfies the criteria of step1,
or a statement saying there are no such control objectives.</li><li>for every new or modified control objective, the criteria for the initial control objectives are met.</li></ol><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="5-decision-making"></a>5.

Also, putting all decisions in a single step allows the governor to delegate the work in steps 3 and 4 to others.</p><p>The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:</p><ol><li>for each control objective for which it was decided (in step 1) that it should be achieved, there is a decision stating whether or not it has been shown to be the case.</li><li>for each proposal from step 4, there is a (preliminary) decision with respect to whether or not it will be adopted.</li></ol><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="controlling-the-control-process-itself"></a>Controlling the control process itself<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#controlling-the-control-process-itself" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Like any other process, the control process may need to be <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance"><span style="font-weight:bold">governed</span></a>. Here is how to apply the specified control process on itself. In order to distinguish the control process that is being governed, from the process that governs that control process, we will refer to the latter as the meta-control process.</p><p>Step 1 (setting the initial control objectives), is as follows:</p><ol><li>the meta-control process has 5 control objectives that it sets to the governor of the control process. These control objectives are specified by the first sentence of the description of each of the 5 activities of the control process in the previous sections;</li><li>for every of these control objectives, its effect indicator is described by the results specified after the line “The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:” of each of the 5 activities;</li><li>a control objective is met if all criteria as mentioned in its effect indicator are met;</li><li>step 5 of the process has been completed at a specified point in time.</li></ol><p>All other steps of the control process can be followed using the aforementioned objectives, effect indicators and criteria.</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/-/tree/master/docs/terms/control-process.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 40 40" style="margin-right:0.3em;vertical-align:sub"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_3SO_"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#short-description" class="table-of-contents__link">Short Description</a></li><li><a href="#control-process" class="table-of-contents__link">Control Process</a></li><li><a href="#controlling-the-control-process-itself" class="table-of-contents__link">Controlling the control process itself</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">eSSIF-Lab</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab">Community</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-vision">Vision</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-objectives">Objectives</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-principles">Principles</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">EU Project</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-project">Project</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://essif-lab.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Project website</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/essif-lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Project gitlab</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">eSSIF-lab Framework</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-fw">Framework</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-governance">Governance</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-fw-bus-arch">Business-architecture</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-fw-func-arch">Functional-architecture</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">eSSIF-lab Terminology</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-terminology">Introduction</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary">Glossary</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/framework/docs/essifLab-pattern-list">Mental Models</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="text--center"><div><p xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">
