(RM) frameworks, such as <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:31000:ed-2:v1:en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 31000</a>, <a href="https://www.coso.org/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COSO</a>, or <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST 800-30</a> have emerged in a time where <a href="/framework/docs/terms/authority"><span style="font-weight:bold">centralized organizational leadership</span></a> and auditing, and cyclic (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDCA</a>) processes for <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk management</span></a>, were prevalent. Most (large) enterprises have adopted (a mix of) them, and many have been certified (e.g. against <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 9001</a> or <a href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 27001</a>) thereby demonstrating they <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance"><span style="font-weight:bold">govern</span></a> and run the associated <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk management</span></a> processes as intended, and are <a href="/framework/docs/terms/compliance"><span style="font-weight:bold">compliant</span></a> with such standards and often also with applicable regulations.</p><p>While useful, these <a href="/framework/docs/terms/normative-framework"><span style="font-weight:bold">frameworks</span></a> don&#x27;t provide actual/practical guidance for all situations. For example, it is well-known that SMEs or other parties that do not have the required (expert) knowledge, time and other resources to setup and run elaborate  processes for <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management"><span style="font-weight:bold">managing</span></a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">their risks</span></a>, are pretty much left to their own devices. Also, larger organizations that use these <a href="/framework/docs/terms/normative-framework"><span style="font-weight:bold">frameworks</span></a> need additional mechanisms to ensure that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk objectives</span></a> set out by the board are actually realized in the &#x27;operational cellars&#x27; of the organization.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p><p>We provide another way of thinking about <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a>. It is based on the postulate that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">parties</span></a> are autonomous <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity"><span style="font-weight:bold">entities</span></a>, that pursue their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">own</span></a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">objectives</span></a>, that perceive the associated <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a>, and set <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk objectives</span></a> to ensure these <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a> are <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">managed</span></a>. While this may not seem to be all that different from what traditional RM <a href="/framework/docs/terms/normative-framework"><span style="font-weight:bold">frameworks</span></a> do at a first glance, there is a big difference between <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">parties</span></a> that realize what it means to be a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a> and how that limits their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/scope-of-control"><span style="font-weight:bold">scope of control</span></a>, and parties that do not. It&#x27;s about their realization where they can exercise their autonomy and where they can - at best - exercise influence.</p><p>Decentralized Risk Management (also called Networked Risk Management (NRM)) is a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk-management</span></a> process that has been designed for <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">parties</span></a> that are aware of their autonomy and its limitations, which implies they are committed to use the parts of the <a href="/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary">eSSIF-Lab terminology</a> that are relevant here (the terms that are emphasized and come with popups in this document). They can use it to <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management"><span style="font-weight:bold">manage</span></a> their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a>, i.e. the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a> associated with their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">own</span></a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">objectives</span></a>, regardless of whether it is consciously or unconsciously aware of them (we assume that most of them are of the &#x27;unconscious&#x27; kind).</p><p>NRM is decentralized because every <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a> runs it on its own, within its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">own</span></a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/scope-of-control"><span style="font-weight:bold">scope of control</span></a>. In an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization"><span style="font-weight:bold">organization</span></a> that is a hierarchy of sub-organizations, such as departments, it is typical that every sub-organization (e.g. the board, the finance department, the security department, divisions, etc.) manages its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">own</span></a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a>, and none other than these. We will see that this setup is capable of producing the result that all <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a> in the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization"><span style="font-weight:bold">organization</span></a> are properly mitigated, and the overall residual <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a> are acceptable.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="traditional-risk-management-and-nrm">Traditional risk management and NRM<a href="#traditional-risk-management-and-nrm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Traditional risk management and NRM" title="Direct link to Traditional risk management and NRM">​</a></h2><p>Processes exist to realize (the results associated with) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">objectives</span></a>.

Their communication basically consists of informing the other about how the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a> that has the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/obligation"><span style="font-weight:bold">obligation</span></a> to produce a result can match the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/expectation"><span style="font-weight:bold">expectations</span></a> of the consuming <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a>, thus ensuring the produced results are fit for the purposes of the consuming <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a>.</p><p>In NRM, consultation is done in two ways.

And for good reason: you will be in charge of whatever you will be managing in such processes. To this we add the requirement is that</p><ul><li>a context must have a single owner, i.e. a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a> that is in charge of what happens in that context, and that consequently should be managing the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a> therein.</li><li>a context must fall within the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/scope-of-control"><span style="font-weight:bold">scope of control</span></a> of its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">owner</span></a>, as it is hard to manage risks or other things if you cannot control them.</li></ul><p>In decentralized contexts we deal with ecosystems of autonomous ((self)sovereign) parties, it is a given that the scope of control of each such party does not extend beyond the party itself - it&#x27;s the very definition of autonomy/sovereignty. A party could use an ISO standard to manage X (risks, ...), but SHOULD limit its scope to be within its own scope of control.
The only guidance that such a party gets from ISO standards regarding how to deal with risks that relate to stuff outside the scope, are the &#x27;identification of &#x27;interested parties&#x27; (that may work with you, or against you) and &#x27;communication&#x27; (about the topics you are managing).
I think that ToIP governance should be aware of this pitfall and SHOULD NOT attempt to create or support <a href="/framework/docs/terms/normative-framework"><span style="font-weight:bold">frameworks</span></a> that are meant to be used to do governance over autonomous parties. Rather, the WG/TF should focus on doing governance that assists such parties as they autonomously make their own, subjective decisions that are good for them individually, but perhaps not so good for others. That&#x27;s a challenge.
But if we succeed here, this can be a real contribution,  not only for ToIP, but also for the various management standards in ISO. So we don&#x27;t do away with such standards, but we complement them by providing ways to deal with larger, decentralized contexts of autonomous parties.
Secondly, governance and trust assurance should not be limited to IT security (ISO 27001, ISO 27005). It should also cover business risks, e.g. of a business transaction going sour. After all, I think that a large part of data in credentials that are being exchanged serve to provide information to parties that are negotiating/conducting a business transaction, so that they can (subjectively/autonomously) assess their individual transaction risk(level)s, and mitigate such risks such that the residual risk becomes acceptable. This, and other topics, aren&#x27;t covered by ISO 27001 nor ISO 27005. So we should take a broader look than these.</p><p>Traditional <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk management</span></a> (RM) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/normative-framework"><span style="font-weight:bold">frameworks</span></a> are currently not fit for use in decentralized contexts. Frameworks such as ISO 31000, or COSO, (tacitly) assume centralized organizational leadership and auditing, and cyclic (PDCA) processes for <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk management</span></a>. While predominantly large enterprises have adopted (a mix of) them, it is way too cumbersome for SMEs and individuals to work with. Also, their being adopted by enterprises suggests they are inappropriate in decentralized, networked contexts. This paper proposes a way for identifying and managing risks and doing the associated governance and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/compliance"><span style="font-weight:bold">compliance</span></a> in a way that <em>is</em> appropriate in such contexts.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2><p>Perhaps the best known approach is based on Assets Threats/Hazards and Vulnerabilities (ATV). It starts with making an inventory of the party&#x27;s assets (things that are valuable to that party), list the threats to such assets (ways in which they lose (part of) their value), and vulnerabilities (weak spots in assets that increase the likelihood of threats being effective). Then, the likelihood of such threats occurring may be assessed, as well as the impact (often: damages) they would have. Combining these two enables a party to assess its risk levels. For the risks that are unacceptable, a treatment plan must be conceived, the execution of which supposedly reduces (or: gets rid of) the risk. This, but also: changing circumstances, change the risks the party runs, which means that it has to repeat all these steps in a continuous management cycle. Mature RM-processes will also include other things, such as communications with the party&#x27;s stakeholders, regular audits, etc.</p><p>Another well known method, predominantly for industry, is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753516300078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bowtie</a>. It focuses on events that may occur, a &#x27;fault tree&#x27; (i.e. a graph that identifies the relevant causes/threats) and an &#x27;event tree&#x27; (i.e. a graph of possible consequences/outcomes). The have the &#x27;barrier&#x27; concepts, which represents a measure that aims to prevent threats from materializing, or reduce the effect of possible consequences. As with ATV, implementing/changing measures, as well as changing circumstances, require set of events and graphs to be appropriately managed. This entails deciding about the (un)acceptability of unwanted consequences, and implementing barriers as needed - which change circumstances.</p><p>RM approaches such as the ones mentioned above have severe practical limitations. Individuals and many SMEs do RM intuitively, they &#x27;know&#x27; where the risks are that need to be mitigated. They consider such approaches as an inefficient way of finding out what they already know. In large organizations, we&#x27;ve seen lots of activities being conducted in order to comply with the RM-process requirements, but did not contribute all that much to managing actual risk.</p><p>An illustration of this is an incident that took place in January 2012 at the Dutch telecom operator KPN. IT security has long been an IT priority for KPN: its CEOs are member of the &#x27;<a href="https://www.cybersecurityraad.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyber Security Raad</a>&#x27;, a national and independent advisory college of the Dutch government whose <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mission"><span style="font-weight:bold">mission</span></a> is to increase cybersecurity throughout the country. Also, its critical services have been certified against ISO 9001 and ISO 27001. Notwithstanding all this, a 17 year old boy <a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/87454/kpn-hacker-zag-acties-als-een-kwajongensstreek.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broke into hundreds of servers</a>, where he could have manipulated KPNs fixed telecom network putting the reachability of the national emergency number 112 (911 in the US) at risk. The question here is why the traditional methods were unable to prevent this from happening.</p><p>Another illustration comes from the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP Top 10</a> list of web application security risks. This list, which exists since 2003 and is regularly updated, shows that the variety of vulnerabilities in applications does not change all that much: injection, broken authentication, cross-site scripting, using components with known vulnerabilities are here to stay. The question here is what is missing in the RM processes of small and large organizations alike that makes many of them deploy systems with such vulnerabilities, in spite of the vast amount of guidance that OWASP provides for preventing them.</p><p>One reason for this may be that risks must be owned. That is to say: there must be a person (not: an organization) that actually feels &#x27;pain&#x27; (discomfort, anxiety, ...) when that risk is not acceptable. This is a different kind of ownership than what we have seen a lot, which is writing the name of a person next to a risk. The latter is ineffective if that person doesn&#x27;t feel the associated pain.</p><p>Another reason is that the number of risks a person needs to deal with must be manageable. <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods/m_cramm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRAMM</a> (1985-2003) is a RM method + tool that helped organizations do their risk assessments by providing threats to, and vulnerabilities of, various kinds of assets. As the number of technological products exploded, so did their database, resulting in a CRAMM risk assessment becoming unacceptably costly and long. Also, it produced ever more mitigation measures. For <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management"><span style="font-weight:bold">managers</span></a>, it was obvious that many of them were irrelevant and the required budgets would not be available.</p><p>A third reason is that risks should be relevant in order to be treated. For example, the risk of leaking a cryptographic key from a crypto chip that is vulnerable to power/timing-attacks is irrelevant e.g. when the chip and its battery are sealed in a physical casing. Also, the risk of crashing your car as a result of an autopilot failure is irrelevant if you never use the autopilot.</p><p>The last reason we mention is that people generally prefer activities that help them realize their objectives rather than activities that do not (visibly) contribute. Many governance, RM and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/compliance"><span style="font-weight:bold">compliance</span></a> (GRC) related activities fall in that second category, except perhaps for people whose job is &#x27;doing GRC&#x27;. Having to do such activities is a typical trait of centrally organized GRC.</p><p>The alternative for putting effort in preventing failures is focusing on the flip-side of that coin, which is: putting effort in realizing successes. It stimulates people to own the associated risks and manage them (it makes the pain go away). When the risks become unmanageable, the associated pain may indicate you have an objective of staying healthy, which you might mitigate by outsourcing the realization of one or more of your objectives.</p><p>To illustrate the difference between these approaches, consider a doctor whose objective is to get her patients in a continuous healthy state and keep them there. When a patient is not in such a state, she won&#x27;t inventory <em>everything</em> that could be wrong with the patient as traditional methods would have her do. Rather, she looks at what is preventing the patient from becoming/remaining healthy, makes a treatment plan, and has it executed.That&#x27;s much easier. And when she needs to see too many patients, she (literally) feels the associated agony and will try to offload some of the patients to trusted colleagues.</p><p>Realizing successes is an inherently decentralized concept, because in the end, being successful always depends on some kind of recognition of others: if you provide a service or product, your success depends on the value they have for your customers, which they express by paying you money, or providing you with a service or product of their own. Positive motivators stimulate parties to increasingly interact and work together to the benefit of both. In contrast, centralized settings have a tendency to use negative motivators to make people interact and work together.</p><p>Different methods have been around for some time now that may be part of decentralized GRC (and in particular: decentralized RM). One such method is the Open Group&#x27;s <a href="https://publications.opengroup.org/c133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dependency Modeling standard</a> (DM - also available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305884742_Open_Group_Standard_Dependency_Modeling_O-DM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResearchGate</a>). It specifies a way by which a party can inventory its goals, and compute the probabilities of achieving them by combining the probabilities of the goals that they depend on. Statistical operations then identify points (objectives) of failure that need to be addressed.</p><p>Another, complementary method is <a href="https://repository.tno.nl/islandora/object/uuid:95b1a97a-2d5c-41b1-b5d9-43bcd04d981b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Networked Risk Management (NRM)</a>. Next to the role of &#x27;objective Owner&#x27;, NRM adds two others: the Producer is the party that is responsible for realizing the results by which it can be established (e.g. by an auditor, or customers) whether or not an objective is met/realized/fulfilled. A Consumer is a party that uses these results for the purpose of realizing one or more objectives that it owns. An objective Owner states the objective, specifies the (auditable) results, and must be the Producer and/or Consumer thereof. Risks are associated with an objective, and map the objective to a risk level, i.e. a measure that is meaningful to the owner and that indicates the extent to which the objective is not (going to be) met. Pragmatically: the amount of &#x27;pain&#x27; (discomfort, anxiety, ...) the objective&#x27;s Owner experiences as it contemplates the chances of it (not) being realized.</p><p>In analogy to &#x27;Self-Sovereign Identity&#x27; - a term used to refer to the sovereignty/autonomy of individuals (and organizations) when it comes to identity-related matters, we introduce the phrase &#x27;Self-Sovereign GRC&#x27; to refer to the sovereignty/autonomy of individuals (and organizations) when it comes to setting their objectives (governance), managing the associated risks of (not) realizing them (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk management</span></a>), and doing what is necessary to become and/or remain part of a community of other self-sovereign entities (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/compliance"><span style="font-weight:bold">compliance</span></a>).</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to help the reader understand what this is all about, so that we can apply the ideas that are deemed useful in the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ToIP Governance Stack Working Group</a>. ideas in the better explain NRM-based <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk management</span></a>, NRMBecause of its focus on NRM is ideally suited for decentralized contexts.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mental-model">Mental Model<a href="#mental-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mental Model" title="Direct link to Mental Model">​</a></h2><p>This chapter describes the mental model for decentralized <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk management</span></a>.

Back in 2013, it was chaired by the CEO of KPN, the leading Dutch telecom operator. Being highly aware of cyber security and associated risks, KPN had a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/normative-framework"><span style="font-weight:bold">framework</span></a> in place, and was certified against ISO 27001. In spite of all this, a 17-year old script-kiddie broke into IT systems of KPN in the beginning of February, which enabled him to intercept internet traffic and manipulate the telephone network to the extent that the emergency call number 112 could have been rendered out of service.

This case demonstrates that there is a difference between an organization having information security awareness at the top management level, having an information security management system in place, and being certified against ISO 27001, and on organization that effectively ensures that (in its &#x27;operational cellars&#x27;) security updates for (crucial) software are actually installed.<a
