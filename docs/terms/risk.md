### Short Description
A **Risk** is the set of effects that uncertainty can have on the intended realization of an [objective](@) that is [owned](@) by a [party](@) (and that therefore also [owns](@) the [risk](@) associated with that [objective](@)). *Uncertainty* is the condition in which a [party](@) lacks information, understanding or [knowledge](@) of events, their consequences or likelihoods. The effects that uncertainty can have on an [objective](@) show as the difference between the results that a [party](@) expects to be produced as it pursues an [objective](@), and the results that will actually be produced in the pursuit of that same [objective](@).

While traditionally these effects are assumed to be negative (i.e. damaging, harmful) to this party, they may also be positive. For example, if you buy a ticket in a lottery, you (should) expect to lose money (the prize of the ticket). However, there is this uncertainty, this lack of information, the effect of it would be that this intended/expected result is deviated from, and you actually win a prize. If this risk is unacceptable (e.g. if you do not know how to manage large amounts of money), then that would call the risk to be [managed](@).

Risk is about the effects that uncertainty can (_possibly_) have on the intended/expected realization of an [objective](@) of some [party](@). In this sense, at least in theory, this means that 'risk' is an objective notion because different parties may have the same ideas about what such effects on a given [objective](@) could be. However, since an  [objective](@) is owned by precisely one [parties](@), and therefore only that party actually knows the actual meaning of that objective, in practice there is little point in drafting lists of such possible effects to make risk assessments easier, and risks can better be considered to be subjective.

An _acceptable risk_ is a set of such effects that the [risk owner](@) has decided that it can, and is willing to deal with as they materialize. They need no further attention. Other risks would need attention and should be [managed](@). Often, risks are assigned a [risk level](@) to help [risk owners](@) prioritize the risks, allowing them to manage the most important ones before the less important ones.

The [owner](@) of a risk that is associated with an [objective](@) must be the [party](@) that [owns](@) that [objective](@), and vice versa, because [ownership](@) implies the [authority](@) to realize the [objective](@), which in turn implies the authority to manage the associated risks. Of course, as [owners](@) are [parties](@), a [risk owner](@) may [mandate](@) actors to execute the actions that are necessary to manage a risk, but that does not relieve the party from its ownership (and facing possibly associated consequences). In fact, the objective of [mandating](@) [risk management](@) activities may come with risks which are often overlooked.

### Purpose
The concept of (managing) risk enables their [owners](@) to become and stay successful. The reason is simple: nobody knows everything so there are always uncertainties, lack of information, understanding or [knowledge](@) of events, their consequences or likelihoods. The effects that such uncertainties can have on the realization of one's [objectives](@), can be very harmful and should be mitigated. Knowing such effects enables parties to mitigate their risks. But also, such uncertainties may be joyful (e.g. as in a lottery), and it may be useful to properly prepare for the opportunities that may arise.
