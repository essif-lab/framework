### Purpose
[Parties](@) that participate in a (business) transaction may use [agents](@), e.g. for conducting communications, exchanging information, etc. We need a term that can be used in the context of an [agent](@)of such a [party](@) to refer to an [actor](@) with which that [agent](@) communicates, and of which it has been established that it is actually an [agent](@) of a [peer](peer-party@) of the [party](@) for which it is communicating.

### Notes
The term '[peer agent](@)' is specifically used in the context of a (digital) [actor](@) that communicates with another (digital) [actor](@) on behalf of a [party](@) that is conducting a (business) transaction with some other [party](@).
