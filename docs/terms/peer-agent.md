### Purpose
<!--State the purpose(s) for which it is necessary (or at least: desirable) to define <New Term>.-->
%%Parties|party%% that participate in a (business) transaction may use %%Agents|agent%%, e.g. for conducting communications, exchanging information, etc. We need a term that can be used in the context of an Agent of such a %%party|party%% to refer to an Actor with which that Agent communicates, and of which it has been established that it is actually an Agent of a %%Peer %%party|party%%|peer-party%% of the %%party|party%% for which it is communicating.

### Notes
<!--Usually, the meaning of a term will not be _exactly_ the same as that of the concept to which it refers. Often, there are slight differences in meaning, or the term may emphasize specific characteristics of the concept, so as to accommodate specific needs of the scope in which it is defined. Please describe such deviations/emphasized characteristics in this section, and which needs that helps accommodate.-->
The term 'peer agent' is specifically used in the context of a (digital) Actor that communicates with another (digital) Actor on behalf of a %%party|party%% that is conducting a (business) transaction with some other %%party|party%%.
