### Purpose
[Parties](@) that participate in a (business) transaction may use [Agents](@), e.g. for conducting communications, exchanging information, etc. We need a term that can be used in the context of an Agent of such a [party](@) to refer to an Actor with which that Agent communicates, and of which it has been established that it is actually an Agent of a [Peer %%party](@)|peer-party[ of the %%party](@) for which it is communicating.

### Notes
The term 'peer agent' is specifically used in the context of a (digital) Actor that communicates with another (digital) Actor on behalf of a [party](@) that is conducting a (business) transaction with some other [party](@).
