### Short Description
An **assessment framework** is the combination of criteria that an auditor can evaluate by applying them to an [entity](@) (of a specific kind), and the procedures that this auditor will follow for doing so, for the purpose of establishing the extent in which that [entity](@) conforms to a stated set of requirements. Thus, an [entity](@) can be assessed against an assessment framework.

An [assessment framework](@) serves a specific purpose, e.g. a risk assessment framework serves to identify, analyze and evaluate [risks](@) for the purpose of selecting and implementing appropriate ways to treat such [risks](@). Other frameworks may serve to assess the [compliance](@) e.g. with a [normative framework](@).

Assessing an [entity](@) against an [assessment framework](@) means that all criteria are evaluated, and each of them is assigned a particular value, the syntax and semantics of which are defined in the [assessment framework](@). For example, an [assessment framework](@) used in [risk management](@) may define [risk levels](@). Similarly, a [framework](@) for [compliance](@) may define [compliance levels](@) Obviously, the kinds of values that may result from such an assessment should be relevant for the purpose that the assessment-framework serves.

An [assessment framework](@) also typically provides principles, ideas, rules, working instructions ([policies](@)) to provide some high-level guidance for the execution of actual assessments.

An [assessment framework](@) may however also provide concrete, practical guidance for doing actual assessments. This can come e.g. in the form of procedures that are to be followed, checklists, reporting templates, etc.

### Purpose
The purpose of an **assessment framework** is to
- enable [parties](@) to determine the usefulness of having (sets of) [entities](@) assessed against that framework, i.e. whether or not the expected results serves a purpose, i.e. realizes an [objective](@) that the [party](@) pursues, and
- enable auditors to actually execute an assessment on a particular (set of) [entities](@), thereby producing (tangible) results that can be used to determine the extent in which these [entities](@) conform to a stated set of requirements.
