### Purpose
<!-- Concisely describe what can you do with the pattern that is (at least) harder if you didn't have it. -->
The **Duties-and-rights pattern** captures the concepts and relations that explain what (generic) duties and rights are, thereby following the [theory of Hohfeld](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/#FormRighHohfAnalSyst), which is not only the basis of %%legal systems|legal-system%% (in %%jurisdictions|jurisdiction%%), but can be used to generically model duties and rights.

### Introduction
<!-- Gently introduce the pattern, by referring to real-world situations and using colloquial terms, so that when someone has read the text, (s)he knows what it is about, and is ready to delve into the specifics of the pattern. -->

### Formalized model
Here is a visual representation of this pattern, using the following **[notations and conventions](../notations-and-conventions#pattern-diagram-notations)**:
