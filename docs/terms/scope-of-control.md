### Short Description
A **Scope of Control (of a Party)** is the extent of the area or subject matter (as in [OED](https://www.lexico.com/definition/scope) that the %%party|party%% controls. One might say that the party is 'sovereign' or 'autonomous' within its scope of control. 

A party that can also control (the behaviour of %%agents|agent%% of) other parties can be referred to as a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% (see also the %%jurisdiction pattern|jurisdiction-pattern%%)

### Purpose
Knowing the **Scope of Control (of a Party)** helps other parties as well as the party itself to determine what (not) to expect of that party.

### Criteria

### Examples
- The scope of control of a nation's government is typically limited by the physical area of the nation and the behaviors that %%actors|actor%% and %%parties|party%% may exhibit there.
- The scope of control of an individual is limited by what it can do by him/herself, and the rights and duties that it has been assigned in or by some %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%.
