### Short Description
A **risk-level** a measure for the deviation of the intended realization (results) of a specific %%objective|objective%% that its %%owner|owner%% uses to represent the priority with which the %%risk|risk%% of that %%objective|objective%% should be reckoned with.

Risk-levels can be expressed in many forms, such as
- one of the first letters of 'Low', 'Medium', or 'High';
- a digit in the interval [1-_n_], where _n_ is usually 4, 5 or 9;
- a combination of digits (indicating the expected impact) and letters (indicating the assessed likelihood);
- a color, e.g. one of 'green', 'yellow' and/or 'orange, 'red';
- a combination of character representation (appealing to the conscious mind of the reader) and a color (appealing to its unconscious mind)

Every %%party|party%% that has a %%risk management|risk-management%% process in place should establish its (personal) set of possible risk-levels and decide which criteria to use for assigning such levels to its (managed) %%objectives|objective%% in a way that is both meaningful and practical for that party.

Note the difference between risk-level and %%risk|risk%%: where risk-level is about _expected_ effects that uncertainties of various kinds may have on the realization of its associated %%objective|objective%%, %%risk|risk%% is about the kinds of (or: _possible_)  effects that such uncertainties can have.

### Purpose
The purpose of risk-levels is that it enables the %%party|party%% that has defined them to compare them, which allows it to prioritize the %%risks|risk%%/%%objectives|objective%% that it needs to manage.
