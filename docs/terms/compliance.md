### Short Description
**Compliance** is the state of realization of a set of conformance criteria or normative framework of a [party](@), where
- a 'normative framework' is a set of related requirements that need to be complemented with a set of conformance criteria in order to be actually testable;
- a 'conformance criteria' is an (actually testable) requirement or condition that must be satisfied to claim conformance (compliance), and

Since [parties](@) are autonomous in deciding what normative frameworks and/or conformance criteria they want to [comply](@) with, we postulate that they [own](@) [compliance objectives](@), i.e. [objectives](@) that aim to realize [compliance](@) with a selected set of conformance criteria and/or normative frameworks.

[Parties](@) can state their [compliance objectives](@) in various ways, e.g. by stating that
- the products it manufactures or uses must comply with their specifications, EU safety regulations, etc.
- the processes that it runs must comply with standards such as ISO 9001 or ISO 27001
- the laws and regulations of the country in which the [party](@) is established must be complied with.

We use the term [compliance management](@) to refer to the [management](@) process that a [party](@) runs for the purpose of realizing its [compliance objectives](@) - in other words: to become and remain [compliant](@) (with the conformance criteria and/or normative frameworks they selected).

Compliance with a set of conformance criteria or a normative framework is typically asserted by a [party](@), and may be attested to by an (independent) auditor.

### Purpose
The purpose of **compliance** (being compliant, or in the process of becoming compliant) is that it may help to mitigate [risks](@), e.g. of being fined for being non-compliant. Also, it may help to provide opportunities; for example, being compliant with the ISO 9001 management requirements is often required for organizations in order to qualify for becoming a supplier.
