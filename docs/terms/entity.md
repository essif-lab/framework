### Short Description
Whenever you know that somethings exists, be it another person, yourself, some computer, an extinct animal, a thought, an idea, a JSON-object, ..., _anything_ you can think of, is what the term **Entity** refers to.

The [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose
This term enables us to refer to anything, or to postulate the existence of something, without further specifying what it is, or how it might be named.

### Criterion
Something, anything, that some [party](@) knows to exist

### Related Concepts
