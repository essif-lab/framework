<p>This pattern captures the essence of how things are done. It answers questions such as: &quot;Who/what does things?&quot;, &quot;How are their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/action" hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context.">actions</a> being guided/<a href="/framework/docs/terms/controller" hovertext="Controller (of an Entity): the role that an Actor performs as it is executing actions on that Entity for the purpose of ensuring that the Entity will act/behave, or be used, in a particular way.">controlled</a>?&quot;, &quot;Who <a href="/framework/docs/terms/controller" hovertext="Controller (of an Entity): the role that an Actor performs as it is executing actions on that Entity for the purpose of ensuring that the Entity will act/behave, or be used, in a particular way.">controls</a> whom/what?&quot;, &quot;Who/what may be held accountable?&quot;. These questions need to have a precise answer if you want to design or implement systems where <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actors</a> can be anything, ranging from programs/apps running on computers as well as <a href="/framework/docs/terms/human-being" hovertext="Human Being: a person of flesh and blood (homo sapiens), that we classify both as a Party, an Actor, and a Jurisdiction.">humans</a>. This pattern provides a way of looking at <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization" hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives.">organizations</a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/human-being" hovertext="Human Being: a person of flesh and blood (homo sapiens), that we classify both as a Party, an Actor, and a Jurisdiction.">people</a>, and non-human <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actors</a>. It shows how they interact with one another, and how they may or may not work for one another. The pattern describes how <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> are &#x27;<a href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereignty" hovertext="Self-Sovereign(ty): the characteristic of every Party that it is autonomous in managing and operating its own Knowledge, particularly in making decisions and deciding how to decide.">(self) sovereign</a>&#x27; as they construct their own world view, reason with that, and make their (subjective) decisions autonomously. It also shows how this <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> is used, where it is used, and also: where it is not used. The latter implies that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> have a limited <a href="/framework/docs/terms/scope-of-control" hovertext="Scope of Control (of a Party): the extent of the area or subject matter that the Party controls.">scope of control</a>, which gives rise to their need to work together with other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a>, that have their own sovereignty. Such interactions with others, however, are outside the scope of this pattern.</p>

Still, it is a common and accepted practice to say something like &quot;<a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TNO</a> has signed a contract&quot;, as if <a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TNO</a> were an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actor</a>. There is no problem with that, as long as we interpret such phrases to mean that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization" hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives.">organization</a> that is said to act is actually using an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actor</a> that acts on its behalf. So, &quot;TNO has signed a contract&quot; means that some <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actor</a> exists that has signed the contract on TNO&#x27;s behalf.</p>
<p>So what is the characteristic that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/human-being" hovertext="Human Being: a person of flesh and blood (homo sapiens), that we classify both as a Party, an Actor, and a Jurisdiction.">people</a> and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization" hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives.">organizations</a> actually share?

<p>We use the term <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

The relevance of this is that all decision making, information processing and the like, which is inherent to a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a>, must <em>therefore</em> be linked to the entity that maintains it (i.e.: a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a>).</p>
<p>This mental model is about how <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actors</a> relate to one another, and how <a href="/framework/docs/terms/action" hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context.">actions</a> are executed by an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actor</a> on behalf of, and using the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> of, a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

The relevance of modeling this somewhat formally is that it will make it easier to build IT systems, where IT (that is running) qualifies as <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actors</a>, and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/human-being" hovertext="Human Being: a person of flesh and blood (homo sapiens), that we classify both as a Party, an Actor, and a Jurisdiction.">people</a> and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization" hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives.">organizations</a> (businesses, enterprises, governments) qualify as <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.
