These questions need to have a precise answer if you want to design or implement systems where <a hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations." href="/framework/docs/terms/actor">actors</a> can be anything, ranging from programs/apps running on computers as well as <a hovertext="Human Being: a person of flesh and blood (homo sapiens), that we classify both as a Party, an Actor, and a Jurisdiction." href="/framework/docs/terms/human-being">humans</a>.

It shows how they interact with one another, and how they may or may not work for one another. The pattern describes how <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples." href="/framework/docs/terms/party">parties</a> are &#x27;<a hovertext="Self-Sovereign(ty): the characteristic of every Party that it is autonomous in managing and operating its own Knowledge, particularly in making decisions and deciding how to decide." href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereignty">(self) sovereign</a>&#x27; as they construct their own world view, reason with that, and make their (subjective) decisions autonomously. It also shows how this <a hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party." href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge">knowledge</a> is used, where it is used, and also: where it is not used.
