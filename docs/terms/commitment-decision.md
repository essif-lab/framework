### Short Description
A **commitment decision** (of a [party](@) in a [business transaction](@)) is the decision of that [party](@) whether or not to commit to that [business transaction](@), i.e. (promise) to fulfill the [obligations](@) that the associated [transaction agreement proposal](@) would impose on that [party](@) once it were signed.

In the [*DEMO*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_%26_Engineering_Methodology_for_Organizations) transaction model, this decision either leads to the canceling of the transaction (if either [party](@) decides not to commit), or to the execution of the transaction (if both [parties](@) have decided to commit).

Typically, a [party](@) will decide to commit if all of the following conditions are met:
1. the [party](@) knows what it is expected to do, and what it will get in return;
2. the [party](@) assesses the cost of the [transaction](@) to be lower than its benefits (there is a net profit);
3. the [risks](@) that the [party](@) perceives to be associated with the [transaction](@) (once committed to) are acceptable.

The relevance of this for SSI is that these conditions are the sources for the party's information ([data](@)) need, and determine the answers to questions such as:
- what [data](@) do I need from what [kinds of credentials](@) so that I can make this decision?
- what assurances need to come with the [data so that it qualifies](@) as valid for making this decision?
The answers to these questions are relevant for a party's ability to formulate a [(presentation) request](@).
