### Short Description
A **concept-file** is a file that contains documentation about a specific [concept](@). To facilitate authors, a self-explanatory [template file](/tev1/concept-file.md) is available.

### Purpose
The ability for people to determine whether or not they are talking about the same 'thing' (idea, concept), is prerequisite for knowing that they (correctly) understand one another - which doesn't imply they agree with each other. Concept files provide the documentation of such [things](@) that contribute to this ability.

### Criterion
a file that defines/specifies a concept.

### Examples
the file that contains this text is an example of a concept-file.
