### Short Description
A **Guardianship-type** is a class of %%guardianship arrangements|guardianship-arrangement%% within the %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% that governs and manages them. It comprises %%duty and right types|pattern-duties-and-rights%% that can be used as a template for instantiating %%duties and rights|pattern-duties-and-rights%% of %%guardianship arrangements|guardianship-arrangement%% that instantiate the %%guardianship-type|guardianship-type%%.

A good way to think abouat a %%guardianship-type|guardianship-type%% is to see it as a template from which instances - i.e. actual %%guardianship arrangements|guardianship-arrangement%% can be derived.

The %%Guardianship pattern|pattern-guardianship%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
The %%Jurisdiction pattern|pattern-jurisdiction%% provides backgrounds on jurisdictions and how they function.

### Purpose
A **Guardianship-type** serves as a template from which instances - i.e. actual %%guardianship arrangements|guardianship-arrangement%% can be instantiated. It allows the %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% within which it is defined to specify generic %%duties and rights|pattern-duties-and-rights%%, both for %%guardians|guardian%% and %%dependents|dependent%%. When the need arises for a guardianship arrangement of that type, this set of roles, duties and rights can conveniently be used as a starting point.

### Criteria
An **guardianship-type** is a class of %%guardianship arrangements|guardianship-arrangement%% that comprises a (non-empty) set of %%duty/right types|pattern-duties-and-rights%% and a set of stakeholder roles of which there is precisely one role that dependents %%dependent|dependent%% get assigned to, and at least one other role for %%guardians|guardian%%, and where the (process) rules for creating instances of that class (i.e. %%guardianship arrangements|guardianship-arrangement%% instantiating  and/or the %%dependent|dependent%% (and perhaps other roles), the semantics of which are defined by the %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%.
