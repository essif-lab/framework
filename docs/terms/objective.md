### Short Description
**Objectives** drive %%parties|party%% as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the **mission** of that %%party|party%%. A %%party's|party%% objectives are part of its %%knowledge|knowledge%%. When made available to %%agents|agent%% of that %%party|party%%, these agents can do the work that is needed to reach these goals (realize the %%party's|party%% objectives).

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)objectives is relevant as objectives are the drivers behind the reasoning and decisions that %%parties|party%% make, the policies and working instructions that they specify so that its %%agents|agent%% know what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. Moreover, objectives are 1-1 associated with risks (i.e. the level of uncertainty that the %%party|party%% experiences regarding whether a specific objective is going to be appropriately realized). Finally, objectives must be known in order to obtain (personal) data according to the [GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).

### Criterion
A text representing something toward which a %%party|party%% directs its efforts: an aim, goal, or end of action.

### Examples
- generically: anything that, according to a %%party|party%% c.q. its way of thinking, is important to be realized, qualifies as an Objective (and identifies its owner as that %%party|party%%).
- most people have the objective 'stay alive'.
- the equivalent in organizations is 'continuation of its existence' (many operate 'business-continuity processes' to realize this, and to identify and mitigate any associated risks).
