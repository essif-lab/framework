### Short Description
A **risk objective** is an [objective](@), owned by a [party](@), that aims to reach and maintain a state of affairs in which the [risks](@) associated with a specific set of its [objectives](@) become, and/or remain, acceptable. The (business) process that seeks to realize [risk objectives](@) is referred to as a [risk management](@) process - this is in line with well-known ISO standards, such as ISO 31000, ISO9001, ISO27001, etc.

There are various ways for [parties](@) to come to grips with specifying and [managing](@) their [risk objectives](@). Here are some examples:

- [Organizations](@) (specifically those with a rather large [scope of control](@)) are known to classify their (regular) [objectives](@) according to (business) topics such as finance, (information) security, safety, quality, legal, human resources etc. This allows them to specify [risk objectives](@) that are particular to such topics, and define equally specific [risk management](@) processes for that.
- [Organizations](@) that realize that their departments (and sub-departments) are actually [parties](@) that each have their [own](@) set of [objectives](@), may require such departments to specify their own [risk objectives](@) and associated [risk management](@) process(es). This enables such [organizations](@) to specify [risk objectives](@) that (only) seek assurances that their departments are properly specifying their own [objectives](@), and [manage](@) the associated [risks](@).
- [Organizations](@) are also known to create [risk objectives](@) that fit traditional [risk management](@) processes, e.g. as defined in ISO standards.
- [Organizations](@) may classify their [objectives](@) using the [formalization of objectives](./objective#formalization) (and the [governance and management pattern](pattern-governance-and-management@)), e.g.
  - [expectations](@), i.e. [objectives](@) the result of which is consumed, but not produced by the [organization](@). Such [objectives](@) are not [managed](@) but [governed](@), and hence require a corresponding [risk management](@) process;
  - [obligations](@), i.e. [objectives](@) the result of which is produced by the [organization](@) and consumed by (at least) one other [party](@). Such [objectives](@) are [managed](@), and also require communication with the consuming [parties](@);
  - controls, i.e. [objectives](@) the result of which is produced and (only) consumed by the [organization](@) itself. These [objectives](@) must be [managed](@) and [governed](@) by the [party](@) that [owns](@) them.

We have observed that (the [management](@) of) the [risks](@) associated with the [objectives](@) that [risk management](@) processes pursue themselves, are often 'forgotten', i.e. these [objectives](@) are not in the scope of any [risk management](@) process. [Parties](@) should set [risk objectives](@) that aim to mitigate the [risks](@) associated with (the [objectives](@) pursued by) their [risk management](@) processes.

Risk objectives should also be associated with [assessment frameworks](@) that auditors will use for determining the [risk-levels](@) for each of these objectives.

### Purpose
The purpose of risk-objectives is help [parties](@) determine and prioritize the work they need to do in order to ensure that the [risks](@) they run become, and/or remain, acceptable.

### Criteria
A [risk-objective](@) is an [objective](@) that
- is associated with one or more (classes of) [objectives](@) that are controlled by the [owner](@) of the [risk-objective](@);
- is associated with one or more [normative frameworks](@) that these (classes of) [objectives](@) are to comply with;
- may be associated with appropriate [assessment frameworks](@) that auditors must use to determine the [level of risk](@).
