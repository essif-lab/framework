<p>This pattern describes how <a href="/framework/docs/terms/term" hovertext="Term: a word or phrase (i.e.: text) that is used in at least one Scope/context to represent a specific Concept.">terms</a> are <a href="/framework/docs/terms/scope" hovertext="Scope: the extent of the area or subject matter (which we use, e.g., to define Patterns, Concepts, Terms and Glossaries in, but it serves other purposes as well).">scoped</a> (which software engineers call &#x27;namespaces&#x27;), how parties govern such scopes/namespaces, and that if you use criteria to define/specify terms, people can test if they have the same understanding of a term by making sure that everyone reaches the same conclusions as they evaluate such criteria in various relevant use-cases.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="purpose">Purpose<a href="#purpose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Purpose" title="Direct link to Purpose">​</a></h2>
<p>The prime objective of working with a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/terminology" hovertext="Terminology (in/of a Scope): the set of terms that are used within a single Scope to refer to a single Definition, enabling Parties to reason and communicate ideas they have about one or more specific topics.">terminology</a> is to enable individual members of a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/community" hovertext="Community: a Party, consisting of at least two different Parties (the members of the Community) that seek to collaborate with each other so that each of them can achieve its individual Objectives more efficiently and/or effectively.">community</a> to understand the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/term" hovertext="Term: a word or phrase (i.e.: text) that is used in at least one Scope/context to represent a specific Concept.">words and phrases</a> that are used by its members <em><strong>in the same, single meaning</strong></em>. This is to say that <em><strong>the differences in the individual understandings of words or phrases by different members of the same <a href="/framework/docs/terms/community" hovertext="Community: a Party, consisting of at least two different Parties (the members of the Community) that seek to collaborate with each other so that each of them can achieve its individual Objectives more efficiently and/or effectively.">community</a> do not pose any problems in their collaborations</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This suggests that (members of) a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/community" hovertext="Community: a Party, consisting of at least two different Parties (the members of the Community) that seek to collaborate with each other so that each of them can achieve its individual Objectives more efficiently and/or effectively.">community</a> need the ability and means to (a) establish and maintain (i.e.: <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owns</a>) their own <a href="/framework/docs/terms/terminology" hovertext="Terminology (in/of a Scope): the set of terms that are used within a single Scope to refer to a single Definition, enabling Parties to reason and communicate ideas they have about one or more specific topics.">terminology</a>, and (b) to ensure it is fit for the purpose of eliminating such misunderstandings.</p>
<p>More concretely, they need the ability and means to</p>
<ul>

Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> has perceived to be living in for as long as it exists) for its individual reasoning, arguing, communicating, decision making etc. Because of this, two <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> that collaborate (i.e.: form a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/community" hovertext="Community: a Party, consisting of at least two different Parties (the members of the Community) that seek to collaborate with each other so that each of them can achieve its individual Objectives more efficiently and/or effectively.">community</a>) cannot be expected to have the same conceptualizations. However, it is a common belief that if one uses a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/term" hovertext="Term: a word or phrase (i.e.: text) that is used in at least one Scope/context to represent a specific Concept.">term</a> to refer to a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;).">concept</a> in its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a>, the other will then relate it to &#x27;the same&#x27; <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;).">concept</a> within its own knowledge, that we should not assume actually exists. For example, when one of them uses the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/term" hovertext="Term: a word or phrase (i.e.: text) that is used in at least one Scope/context to represent a specific Concept.">term</a> &#x27;identity&#x27;, it knows which <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;).">concept</a> that relates to within its own <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a>. However, others need to hallucinate as to what that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;).">concept</a> might be, and typically respond by thinking that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;).">concept</a> that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/term" hovertext="Term: a word or phrase (i.e.: text) that is used in at least one Scope/context to represent a specific Concept.">term</a> refers to in their own <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> would be its intended meaning. In many cases that doesn&#x27;t pose a problem, because the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;).">concepts</a> of both <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledges</a> are &#x27;sufficiently the same&#x27;. In other cases, the differences in meaning may be such that it disrupts the collaboration between the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a>. And that is when it helps to have &#x27;good <a href="/framework/docs/terms/definition" hovertext="Definition: a text that helps Parties to have the same understanding about the meaning of (and Concept behind) a Term, ideally in such a way that these Parties can determine whether or not they make the same distinction.">definitions</a>&#x27;, because they have the property that collaborators can assess whether or not the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;).">concepts</a> in their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> (that a well-defined <a href="/framework/docs/terms/term" hovertext="Term: a word or phrase (i.e.: text) that is used in at least one Scope/context to represent a specific Concept.">term</a> refers to) are &#x27;sufficiently the same&#x27;.</p>
<p>In order to keep the work of devising <a href="/framework/docs/terms/definition" hovertext="Definition: a text that helps Parties to have the same understanding about the meaning of (and Concept behind) a Term, ideally in such a way that these Parties can determine whether or not they make the same distinction.">definitions</a> to a minimum, it helps to know the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objectives</a> that the members of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/community" hovertext="Community: a Party, consisting of at least two different Parties (the members of the Community) that seek to collaborate with each other so that each of them can achieve its individual Objectives more efficiently and/or effectively.">community</a> collaboratively seek to realize. Any <a href="/framework/docs/terms/definition" hovertext="Definition: a text that helps Parties to have the same understanding about the meaning of (and Concept behind) a Term, ideally in such a way that these Parties can determine whether or not they make the same distinction.">definition</a> should define a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;).">concept</a> that is relevant for that collaboration. Other definitions are just useless work.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a
