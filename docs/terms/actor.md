### Short Description
An **Actor** is someone or something that can actually do things, such as people or machines. Actors will generally do things, i.e. execute %%actions|action%% in different ways, depending on the context, or the %%party|party%% for whom they do this.

The %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)actors allows one to determine which (kinds of) actors are capable of executing which (kinds of) %%actions|action%%, specifically since %%organizations|organization%% do not qualify as an actor (they need actors to get things done).

### Criterion
Entity that is capable of actually executing %%actions|action%% (acting, doing things).

### Examples

- People (human beings) obviously qualify, as do robots and other machines.
- Stones, pictures, ideas, etc. do not qualify.
- Software applications qualify, provided they are actually running on hardware. An app that is just sitting e.g. on a mobile phone but isn't executed does not qualify.
- Enterprises, governments, and other %%organizations|organization%% do not qualify.
