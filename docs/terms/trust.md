### Short Description
**Trust** (of a [party](@) in X) is the (un)conscious decision by that [party](@) that X is in fact the case. X can be anything. To trust is to believe to the extent that one can rely on X to be the case. One can trust a president - e.g. to make the right decisions. One may trust (rely on) one's own judgements or conscience.

[Trust](@) is distinct from [trust level](@), which is a (subjective) *degree* of belief or confidence that a [party](@) has in (the truth of) X. In order to trust X, the associated [trust level](@) of X would need to have exceeded some threshold, which typically depends on the consequences the [party](@) would like it to have. For example, a [party](@) may associate some [trust level](@) to the [statement](assertion@) "Mr Salesmann will not sell me junk" The threshold for that [party](@) actually trusting that this is in fact the case is typically lower when the [party](@) buys a pear from Mr Salesmann, than when it would buy a house from Mr Salesmann.

Trust is not something that is given, but something that [parties](@) (un)consciously, and continually decide about - it changes over time. Since [parties](@) are autonomous, their [trust](@) is highly subjective. As a consequence, the idea of having 'trusted registries', 'trusted issuers' that do not take this subjectivity into account basically act as [(centralized) authorities](authority@), is a denial of the fact that [parties](@) are autonomous. While we acknowledge that such ideas (have a right to) exist, we do not follow them.

In many practical situations, trust has a few basic issues, in that it is often not clear
- who the actual [party](@) is in which the belief or confidence is rooted, i.e. that decides about that [trust](@).
- what X actually is, i.e. what it is that the [party](@) believes to be true (confides in, relies on).
