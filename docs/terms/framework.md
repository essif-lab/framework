### Short Description
A **(conceptual) framework** is set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality. The eSSIF-Lab framework is such a conceptual framework.

Outside of eSSIF-Lab, the term 'framework' is also used in meanings such as defined by the [American Heritage Dictionary](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=framework):
1. A structure for supporting or enclosing something else, especially a skeletal support used as the basis for something being constructed.
2. An external work platform; a scaffold.
3. A fundamental structure, as for a written work.
4. A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality.
