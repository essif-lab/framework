### Short Description
A **Role name** is a name by which a %%role|role%% can be referred to, and which %%identifies|identifier%% that %%role|role%% in contexts in which it is used. Accordingly, using it without properly referencing the context may cause misunderstandings, as role names refer to different %%roles|role%% in different contexts.

A role name is also used to refer to an (arbitrary) %%entity|entity%% that performs the %%role|role%% that the role name actually refers to. For example if 'issuer' is a role-name for %%entities|entity%%. For example, the role name '%%Agent|agent%%' is used to generically refer to an (arbitrary) %%actor|actor%% that is executing some %%action|action%% on behalf of a %%party|party%%.
