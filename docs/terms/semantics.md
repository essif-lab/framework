### Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the semantics to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
We use the term **semantics** to refer to the mapping between (tangible) %%terms|term%% and (intangible) %%concepts|concept%% (their meaning, the ideas behind it). Semantics are scoped, i.e. every %%scope|scope%% has its own semantic mapping. This implies that every %%party|party%% has - and maintains - its own (subjective) semantics, which is its subjective mapping of a set of terms onto the concepts/ideas in its %%knowledge|knowledge%%. The (erroneous) assumption that %%parties|party%% would (automagically) share a semantics is the cause of many misunderstandings, and hence should be identified and deleted as soon as possible.

### Purpose
<!--Describe why the semantics is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this semanticsevant within its scope of definition?-->
The ability to distinguish between (non)semantics helps us to better understand one another, because it makes one aware of the fact that semantics is subjective, and its owner can update it. This allows such an owner to (temporarily) use terms in the same meaning as another %%party|party%%, specifically if they agree to use %%good definitions|definition%%.

### Criteria
<!--REQUIRED--How is this semantics different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the semantics, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the semanticsomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.-->
A semantics is a mapping, in a specific %%scope|scope%%, between (tangible) %%terms|term%% and (intangible) %%concepts|concept%% (their meaning, the ideas behind it).
