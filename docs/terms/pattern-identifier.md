### Purpose
The **Identifier pattern** captures the concepts and relations that help to explain how [identifiers](@) are defined and used for [identification](@) purposes.

Related topics can be found in the [identity pattern](pattern-identity@) and the [identification pattern](pattern-identification@).

### Introduction


### Formalized model
Here is a visual representation of this pattern, using the following **[notations and conventions](../notations-and-conventions#pattern-diagram-notations)**:

<img
  alt="Conceptual model of the 'Identifier' pattern"
  src={useBaseUrl('images/patterns/pattern-identifier.png')}
/>

The figure shows a context, in which an [agent](@) of a [party](@) that perceives the context (and its contents) uses [identifiers](@) for the purpose of [identifying](@) [entities](@) within that context. Typical contexts are those in which a computer system/application acts as such an [agent](@), but any other situation where (an [agent](@) of) a [party](@) is [acting](@) has its own particular context. The context is significant, because within that context, not every [entity](@) that a [party](@) knows to exist will be (expected to be) present, or needed to be [identified](@).

It is assumed that [identifiers](@) are associated with specific classes of [entities](@). Such associations may differ between contexts. For example, in the context of discussing war planes, the [identifier](@) `B52` refers to a class of bomber planes, whereas in the context of Schiphol Amsterdam airport, `B52` would refer to a (boarding) gate, and in the context of drinks, it would refer to a specific [cocktail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-52_(cocktail)). Examples in the IT include [identifiers](@) in the syntax of e-mail addresses, which may be used as an email address, as a username for logging in, as a SIP address (for making calls over the Internet), etc.

Typically, [identifications](@) for which [identifiers](@) are used are limited to specific contexts where the [actor](@) that executes the [identification-act](@) knows the kind of [entity](@) that needs to be [identified](@), and when using some [identifier](@), it would expect it to be useable for instances of such a kind.

The figure introduces the concept `ID`, the idea of which is that it is a composition of whatever it takes in terms of [identifiers](@) to be able to identify an [entity](@) of a specific type in a specific context. In the simplest case (in a small context, without many [entities](@) to choose from), a single [identifier](@) may suffice - specifying the entity type may not even be necessary. In other cases, a single identifier m ay not suffice, and multiple identifiers are necessary

:::info Editor's note
Text to be added from here on. Thoughts revolve around changing 'entity type' to 'attribute type' or such. That might result in a mapping (Entity, Attribute Type, Identifier) in the current figure to (subject, predicate, object) or perhaps better: (subject, key, value), i.e. (key, value) pairs for an implied subject. That could form the basis of doing identification in the data realm (which is currently still lacking)
