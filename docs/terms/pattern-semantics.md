### Purpose

The **Semantics Pattern** describes the relations between the (intangible) %%Concepts|concept%% that are part of a %%party's|party%% %%knowledge|knowledge%%, and how they are (tangibly) represented by %%terms|term%%, %%attributes|attribute%%, etc. The ability to create and maintain such a mapping (which is known as a %%semantics|semantics%%) is critical for forstering a common understanding between %%parties|party%% that work together to realize specific %%objectives|objective%%. The quality of the mapping depends on the extent to which the %%definitions|definition%% that are being used have the property of demonstrably leading to %%parties|party%% making the same distinctions, i.e. having a sufficiently similar understanding of such %%terms|term%%.

### Introduction

:::info Editor's note
Storyline that needs to be worked out:
- it is impossible to really understand one another because Knowledge is intangible.
- next best is to create tangible, so called (terminological) artifacts that a party can be create/obtain, store, process, disseminate, for the purpose of enabling other parties to 'understand' (parts of) what it knows.
- %%definitions|definition%% are the prime examples of such artifacts; ideally, they are phrased as criteria so that different %%parties|party%% can all assess these criteria in different use-cases (relevant for the %%objectives|objective%% they all seek to realize), and subsequently agree on whether or not they have all interpreted some criteria in some use-case in the same manner, and _if_ they do, conclude that they have the same understanding about the disctincion that the criteria makes (at least to the extent to where the use-cases go).
- other artifacts may also help in understanding each other's knowledge. Such artifacts include more casual explanations, a formal or informal description of how the various concepts that are being explained (or defined) relate to one another, etc. Thus, we expect to see [knowledge artifacts of different kinds to be created, maintained, evaluated and continually improved on.
- establishing a set of such %%definitions|definition%%, associated %%terms|term%% (a 'common %%terminology|terminology%%') enables the %%parties|party%% to express characteristics of %%entities|entity%% as (scoped!) %%attributes|attribute%%, and hence a %%partial identity|partial-identity%% of an %%entity|entity%% in a (digital) representation.

The %%pattern|pattern%% also hints at the relation between %%semantics|semantics%% and
