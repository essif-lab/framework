### Purpose

The **Semantics Pattern**  describes the relations between the (intangible) %%Concepts|concept%% that are part of a %%party's|party%% %%knowledge|knowledge%%, and how they are (tangibly) represented by %%terms|term%%, %%attributes|attribute%% etc. The ability to create and maintain such a mapping (which is known as a %%semantics|semantics%%) is critical for forstering a common understanding between %%parties|party%% that work together to realize specific %%objectives|objective%%. The quality of the mapping depends on the extent to which the %%definitions|definition%% that are being used have the property of demonstrably leading to %%parties|party%% making the same distinctions, i.e. having a sufficiently similar understanding of such %%terms|term%%.

### Introduction

:::info Editor's note
Storyline that needs to be worked out:
- it is impossible to really understand one another because Knowledge is intangible.
- next best is to create tangible artifacts that can be obtained, stored, processed, disseminated, and that can be assigned 'allusions', or 'hints' towards what individual %%parties|party%% take it to mean.
- we use %%definitions|definition%% as such 'hints'; ideally, they are phrased as criteria that different %%parties|party%% can assess in use-cases (relevant for the %%objectives|objective%% they all seek to realize), and of which they can agree on whether or not they all interpret them in the same manner (i.e.: make the same distinctions using the criteria)
- establishing a set of such %%definitions|definition%%, associated %%terms|term%% (a 'common %%terminology|terminology%%') enables the %%parties|party%% to express characteristics of %%entities|entity%% as (scoped!) %%attributes|attribute%%, and hence a %%partial identity|partial-identity%% of an %%entity|entity%% in a (digital) representation.
