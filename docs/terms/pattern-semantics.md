# Semantics Pattern

:::info Editor's note
This is work that is still an idea. If you want to help, do so by telling us [in a new issue](https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/issues/new).

### Purpose

The **Semantics Pattern** describes the relations between the (intangible) [Concepts](@) that are part of a [party's](@) [knowledge](@), and how they are (tangibly) represented by [terms](@), [attributes](@), etc. The ability to create and maintain such a mapping (which is known as a [semantics](@)) is critical for forstering a common understanding between [parties](@) that work together to realize specific [objectives](@). The quality of the mapping depends on the extent to which the [definitions](@) that are being used have the property of demonstrably leading to [parties](@) making the same distinctions, i.e. having a sufficiently similar understanding of such [terms](@).

### Introduction

:::info Editor's note
Storyline that needs to be worked out:
- it is impossible to really understand one another because Knowledge is intangible.
- next best is to create tangible, so called (terminological) artifacts that a party can be create/obtain, store, process, disseminate, for the purpose of enabling other parties to 'understand' (parts of) what it knows.
- [definitions](@) are the prime examples of such artifacts; ideally, they are phrased as criteria so that different [parties](@) can all assess these criteria in different use-cases (relevant for the [objectives](@) they all seek to realize), and subsequently agree on whether or not they have all interpreted some criteria in some use-case in the same manner, and _if_ they do, conclude that they have the same understanding about the disctincion that the criteria makes (at least to the extent to where the use-cases go).
- other artifacts may also help in understanding each other's knowledge. Such artifacts include more casual explanations, a formal or informal description of how the various concepts that are being explained (or defined) relate to one another, etc. Thus, we expect to see [semantic units](@) of different kinds to be created, maintained, evaluated and continually improved on.
- establishing a set of such [definitions](@), associated [terms](@) (a 'common [terminology](@)') enables the [parties](@) to express characteristics of [entities](@) as (scoped!) [attributes](@), and hence a [partial identity](@) of an [entity](@) in a (digital) representation.

The [pattern](@) also hints at the relation between [semantics](@) and
