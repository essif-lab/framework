# Risk management

### Short Description

**Risk management** is a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific [party](@) for the purpose of [managing](management@) the [risks](@) that it [owns](@) (thereby realizing specific [risk objectives](risk-objective@)). The overall [risk objective](@) that [parties](@) seek to [manage](management@) is to ensure that the set of all [risks](@) that they perceive to run are, as a whole, acceptable.

For various purposes, a [party](@) may decide to run multiple [risk management](@) processes. For example, it may run one process for [managing](management@) the [risks](@) related to quality, or information security, or environmental issues. This allows a [party](@) to design, maintain and realize [risk objectives](risk-objective@) that are tailored to such topics. Also, a [party](@) may run different [risk management](@) processes (perhaps with the same [risk objectives](risk-objective@)) for different parts of its [scope of control](@). However, a [party](@) should ensure that the combination of these processes result in its overall [risk management](@) to be complete, coherent and consistent.

For the [risk management](@) of a [party](@) to be *complete*, it must (explicitly or implicitly) define and maintain a set of [risk objectives](risk-objective@), such that when every of these [objectives](@) has been realized, the remaining (residual) [risks](@) (associated with the set of all [objectives](@) [owned](@) by this [party](@)) is, as a whole, acceptable. One [risk objective](@) of a [party](@) was mentioned in the previous paragraph (i.e. that the overall [risk management](@) should be complete, coherent and consistent"). Other well-known objectives are that [risk management](@) should be certifiable against some standard, e.g. ISO 9001 for quality, ISO 27001 for information security, or ISO 14001 for environmental risks.

For the [risk management](@) of a [party](@) to be *coherent*, any [risk management](@) process that it runs (or has outsourced) will only take [risks](@) into account for [objectives](@) that are [owned](@) by that [party](@). This can easily be explained by observing that both the [objectives](@) and (associated) [risks](@) should be managed within the context of a single [knowledge](@), being that of their [owner](@). Also, given that [parties](@) are autonomous, they can only [manage](management@) what is their own [scope of control](@).

For the [risk management](@) of a [party](@) to be *consistent*, it must ensure that the [risk management](@) detects signals that indicate a change in the risks, e.g. signals that detect:
- a change in [risk level](@) of an existing [objective](@);
- an [objective](@) that is being added to, modified within, or deleted from the set of [objectives](@) whose associated [risks](@) the process [manages](management@);
- a change in the set of [risk objectives](risk-objective@) that the process pursues.

We distinguish between the following kinds of risk-management:
- **centralized risk-management**, which is a kind of [risk management](@) that assumes that the [party](@) that runs it has the power or right to give orders, make decisions that other parties must follow, and enforce obedience, which can be applied to mitigate its [risks](@). This kind of risk-management ignores the natural autonomy of other [parties](@), and hence may have consequences that the [party](@) cannot [control](controller@).
- **decentralized or networked risk-management**, which is a kind of [risk management](@) that assumes that the [party](@) that runs it acknowledges the autonomy of other [parties](@) to determine their own [objectives](@) and [manage](management@) the associated [risks](@) as they see fit. This implies that this [party](@) will communicate with these other [parties](@) about their mutual [expectations](@), and find ways that help each other to manage their individual, subjective [risks](@).

### Purpose

The purpose of a **Risk Management** process (that is run by, or on behalf of, some [party](@)), is to manage the [risks](@) that it [owns](@) within its [scope of control](@). This may entail helping its stakeholders, i.e. the [parties](@) that either produce or consume the results of [objectives](@) that this [party](@) owns, to [manage](management@) their [risks](@) as well.

### Criterion

A Risk Management (process) is a set of related [activities](@) that a [party](@) runs for the purpose of realizing a set of [risk objectives](risk-objective@) that it [owns](@), where the realization of these [risk objectives](risk-objective@) ensure that (a specific subset of) the set of all [objectives](@) that the [party](@) [owns](@) come with associated [risks](@) that, on the whole, this [party](@) finds acceptable.
