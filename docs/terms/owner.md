### Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
An **Owner** is a role that a %%party|party%% performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some %%entity|entity%%. 

We interpret 'legal' and 'rightful' as terms that apply to _any_ %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% (that is: not just %%legal/national jurisdictions|legal-jurisdiction%%, but also those of other %%organizations|organization%% (%%parties|party%%).

We take 'natural' as a title that is provided by nature, as in 'the owner of an %%assertion|assertion%%'.

For futher details, see %%ownership|ownership%%.

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)owners of an %%entity|entity%% enables one to identify the %%party|party%% and the duties (and rights) it has regarding the %%owned|owned%%. One may want to do so either to establish whether or not the %%owned|owned%% %%entity|entity%%, e.g. if it is an %%actor|actor%%, can be trusted to behave according to its %%owner's|owner%% %%policies|policy%%. Or, one may want to do this in order to settle a dispute it has.

### Criteria
A %%party|party%% is said to be the **owner** of some %%(legal) entity|legal-entity%% in some %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% if and only if an %%ownership relation|ownership%% exists with that %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%.
