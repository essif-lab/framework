identities work, how this relates to (attributes in) <a hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party." href="/framework/docs/terms/credential">credentials</a>, and how all this can be made to work in <a hovertext="Self-Sovereign Identity (or SSI): a term that has many different interpretations, and

rel="noopener noreferrer">used in many ways</a> in different contexts, and is often related to intangibles, such as feelings, emotions, ideas of belonging, and the like. However, in <a hovertext="Self-Sovereign Identity (or SSI): a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) Parties as they negotiate and execute electronic Transactions with one another." href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereign-identity">SSI contexts</a>, we need to work with tangible things - specifically: data that can be issued, stored, processed, transferred, requested and obtained. Still, in such contexts, we have observed that people use the term &#x27;identity&#x27; to refer to various concepts/ideas, e.g.:</p><ul><li>a string of alphanumeric characters that can be used to <a hovertext="Identifier: a character string that is being used for the identification of some Entity (yet may refer to 0, 1, or more Entities, depending on the context within which it is being used)." href="/framework/docs/terms/identifier">identify</a> someone, e.g. a name or an identification number (in general: an <a hovertext="Identifier: a character string that is being used for the identification of some Entity (yet may refer to 0, 1, or more Entities, depending on the context within which it is being used)." href="/framework/docs/terms/identifier">identifier</a>),</li><li>a (coherent) set of <a hovertext="Assertion: a declaration/statement, made by a specific Party, that something is the case." href="/framework/docs/terms/assertion">assertions</a> (statements, claims) about someone, represented as data, e.g. digital, or in print, usually including an <a hovertext="Identifier: a character string that is being used for the identification of some Entity (yet may refer to 0, 1, or more Entities, depending on the context within which it is being used)." href="/framework/docs/terms/identifier">identifier</a> of some kind;</li><li>an artifact that contains such data, e.g. a passport, a (digitally signed) credential.</li></ul><p>(Digital) identities, or personal data, are often associated with the ability to <a hovertext="Identify: an Act, by or on behalf of a Party, that results in the selection of either (a) a single Partial identity that the party Owns, given some (observed or received) data, or (b) a single Entity from a given set of entities that is the Subject of a specified Partial identity that the party Owns." href="/framework/docs/terms/identify">identify</a> a person. <a href="https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pfitzmann and Hansen, 2010</a>, who tried to come up with a consolidated set of terms for identity and privacy, say that &#x27;identity&#x27; is <em>a subset of attribute values of a person which sufficiently identifies this person within any set of persons</em>. The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN#d1e1489-1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDPR definition of personal data</a> is &quot;<em>any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&#x27;data <a hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc." href="/framework/docs/terms/subject">subject</a>&#x27;); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person</em>&quot;.</p><a hovertext="Definition: a text that helps Parties to have the same understanding about the meaning of (and Concepts behind) a Term, ideally in such a way that these Parties can determine whether or not they make the same distinction." href="/framework/docs/terms/definition">Definitions</a> such as these have various difficulties, perhaps the most prominent of which is that they do not provide a criterion that different people can use for determining whether or not something qualifies as an &#x27;identity&#x27;, and be in agreement on that. As a consequence, the relevance of having an identity, particularly in an <a hovertext="Self-Sovereign Identity (or SSI): a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) Parties as they negotiate and execute electronic Transactions with one another." href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereign-identity">SSI context</a>, is not clear. Therefore, rather than searching for an answer to the question what an identity is, or should be, this <a hovertext="Pattern (also: Mental Model): A description, both casual and formal, of a set of Concepts (ideas), relations between them, and constraints, that together form a coherent and consistent &#x27;viewpoint&#x27;, or &#x27;way of thinking&#x27; about a certain topic." href="/framework/docs/terms/pattern">pattern</a> seeks to identify the <a hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;)." href="/framework/docs/terms/concept">concepts</a> (ideas), relations between them, and constraints, that together form a coherent and consistent &#x27;viewpoint&#x27;, or &#x27;way of thinking&#x27; about who or what an <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a> actually _is_.

This seems to be very much in line with the paradigm of <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-self-is-not-singular-but-a-fluid-network-of-identities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">identity as a network</a>, as worked out by Kathleen Wallace: &quot;<a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Network-Self-Relation-Process-and-Personal-Identity-1st-Edition/Wallace/p/book/9780367077488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Network Self</a>&quot;.</p><p>In our model, we postulate that <a hovertext="Identity (of an Entity): the combined Knowledge about that Entity of all Parties, i.e. the union of all Partial Identities of which that Entity is the Subject." href="/framework/docs/terms/identity">identity</a> is related to who or what an <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a> actually <em>is</em>, and that this is the combined perception (<a hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party." href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge">knowledge</a>) of all <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

The other figures (a judge, a photographer, a colleague, and a mechanic) represent <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples." href="/framework/docs/terms/party">parties</a>, each of which has its own view on the protagonist. The photographer finds him expressionless and dull, his colleague considers Piet to be reliable and helpful. They all have their own, subjective view on the protagonist, which can be expressed in terms of judgements and characteristics that they attribute to the protagonist. The number of parties that know about the protagonist will initially be very small, but will become larger over time. Also, the judgements and characteristics that parties attribute to the protagonist will develop and change over time.</p><p>It seems reasonable to say that the set of all judgements and characteristics that parties have attributed to the protagonist at some point in time represent who or what that protagonist actually <em>is</em> (at that time), and we might call that its <a hovertext="Identity (of an Entity): the combined Knowledge about that Entity of all Parties, i.e. the union of all Partial Identities of which that Entity is the Subject." href="/framework/docs/terms/identity">identity</a>.</p><p>However, this term has little practical relevance. First, the <a hovertext="Semantics: a mapping between the (tangible/textual) Terms and (intangible) ideas/Concepts - their meaning." href="/framework/docs/terms/semantics">semantics</a> of any attribution is (autonomously) decided by the attributing <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples." href="/framework/docs/terms/party">party</a>, implying that attributes of different parties cannot be readily compared. The figure illustrates this by having the mechanic judge the protagonist to be unreliable, whereas the colleague finds him reliable. But even if parties agree, e.g. the photographer and mechanic both characterize the protagonist as a customer, but it does mean different things. While for a photographer, a customer is a person that it can instruct to sit down, perhaps do some make-up on, and take a picture of, this is not the case for a mechanic.</p><p>More importantly, in interactions between the protagonist and an arbitrary <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

Any information about the protagonist that is used for that must therefore come from the part of the protagonist&#x27;s identity that is also part of that <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

It implies that the identity of such an entity is the union of all of its partial identities.</p><p>This use of attributions is particularly relevant for <a hovertext="Self-Sovereign Identity (or SSI): a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) Parties as they negotiate and execute electronic Transactions with one another." href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereign-identity">SSI contexts</a> in which the focus is on supporting (electronic) <a hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)." href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction">transactions</a>.
