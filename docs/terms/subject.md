### Short Description
The **Subject** of some coherent data set is the (single) [entity](@) to which that data set relates/pertains. Examples of such sets include attributes, [Claims/Assertions](@), files/dossiers, [(verifiable) credentials](@), [(partial) identities](@), etc.

Note that without this data set, the use of this term is meaningless. Therefore, [subject](@) must be seen as a relation (between a data set and an [entity](@)), rather than as this [entity](@) itself (as is commonly done).

Sometimes, the term 'subject' is also used in the meaning of 'reference to the (single) [entity](@) [etc.]' or '[identifier](@) for the (single) [entity](@) [etc.]' rather than the (single) [entity](@) itself. We discourage such practices, and suggest to use the term 'subject identifier' in such cases.

### Purpose
The term **subject** provides a generic way to link [entities](@) that exist in the real (physical) world with [knowledge](@) about them (e.g. characteristics, [partial identities](@) and such) that exists in the minds of various [parties](@).
