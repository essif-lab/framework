Explain that validation is not verification:
- verification (of data) is the process of determining whether or not what the data represents is in fact true (veracity).
- validation (of data) is the process of determining whether or not data can be used to base a decision on. For example, a liquor selling party may determine that if someone simply says (s)he is 18+, that is valid data for deciding whether or not to sell the liquor, regardless of whether or not that statement is true.
