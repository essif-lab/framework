<p>The <strong>Identification pattern</strong> captures the concepts and relations that help to explain the mechanisms that a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> uses to <a href="/framework/docs/terms/identify" hovertext="Identify: an Act, by or on behalf of a Party, that results in the selection of either (a) a single Partial identity that the party Owns, given some (observed or received) data, or (b) a single Entity from a given set of entities that is the Subject of a specified Partial identity that the party Owns.">identify</a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entities</a>, and mechanisms for communicating with another party such that both parties can identify an entity and know whether or not they identify the same entity.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h3>
<p>In &#x27;the wild&#x27;, terms such as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/identify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">identify</a>, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/identification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">identification</a>, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/identity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">identity</a> are defined such that the can be used without all too many problems in everyday discussions. However, if we want to use these terms for our <a href="/framework/docs/essifLab-objectives">purposes</a>, their definition must be much more precise, particularly because we want to use them in IT-contexts. Lets show this by example.</p>
<p>Here, we discuss <a href="/framework/docs/terms/identify" hovertext="Identify: an Act, by or on behalf of a Party, that results in the selection of either (a) a single Partial identity that the party Owns, given some (observed or received) data, or (b) a single Entity from a given set of entities that is the Subject of a specified Partial identity that the party Owns.">identification</a> in a way that we expect to be useful in IT-contexts (or non-IT, but still administrative contexts). Basically, two things are needed:</p>
<p>First, identification of an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a> is similar to recognizing that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a>. A bit more formal: given an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a> (or digital or non-digital <a href="/framework/docs/terms/data" hovertext="Data: something (tangible) that can be used to communicate a meaning (which is intangible/information).">data</a> about that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a> that comes from outside the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> of a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a>), identification is determining whether or not the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owns</a> a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identity</a> of which that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a> is the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/subject" hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc.">subject</a>. When the entity isn&#x27;t recognized (identified), then a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identity</a> may be created that has this <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a> as its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/subject" hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc.">subject</a>.</p>
<p>Second, identification of an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a> is similar to pointing/singling out the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a>.

<p>Suppose you are at home and the doorbell rings. When you open the door you see a person of which you will gather further characteristics (properties), e.g. by observing their looks, by characterizing that person&#x27;s voice (pitch, intonation), and interpreting what the person says, etc. You may even elicit further observations, e.g. by asking things. All of this serves the purpose of &#x27;establishing the identity of&#x27; (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/identify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merriam-Webster, identify, 1a</a>) that person, where &#x27;identity&#x27; would be &#x27;the distinguishing character(istics) or personality of an individual&#x27; (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/identity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merriam-Webster, identity, 1a</a>).</p>
<p>You could also phrase this as recognizing the person, i.e. tapping into your own <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> to see what you already know about this person, which - in terms of our <a href="/framework/docs/terms/identity" hovertext="Identity (of an Entity): the combined Knowledge about that Entity of all Parties, i.e. the union of all Partial Identities of which that Entity is the Subject.">identity pattern</a> would be: determining which of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identities</a> you <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owns</a> have the person at the door as its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/subject" hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc.">subject</a>. The purpose of all this is that as you remember what you know about the person, that helps you to decide whether or not, and if so, how to further engage with him/her. This would mean that you gather characteristics of that person (the fact that it actually is a person being the first of such characteristics), and continue to do so until there is only one <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identity</a> that has all these characteristics.</p>
<p>Continuing the example, it could be that you have no recollection of that person, i.e. there is no <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identity</a> in your <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> that has all these characteristics. In this case you would already have started to create a new <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identity</a> for which that person is the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/subject" hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc.">subject</a>, and you would have started to attribute characteristics (with some level of certainty) to this person, which all are part of this new <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identity</a>. Doing this enables you to identify/recognize this person the next time (s)he comes to your house.</p>
<p>The identification process is said to fail if a user record or <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identity</a> has been selected, but its actual <a href="/framework/docs/terms/subject" hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc.">subject</a> is not the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a> that supposedly is identified.

<p>Suppose you want to have a drink with your friend in a cafe. When you open the door of the cafe, you visually and auditorily &#x27;examine&#x27; the set of people that are present, perhaps calling out to your friend, until you recognize one of these people as your friend. Having &#x27;identified&#x27; your friend enables you to interact with him/her as you planned.</p>
<p>A bit more formally, we would say that what you actually do is acquire <a href="/framework/docs/terms/data" hovertext="Data: something (tangible) that can be used to communicate a meaning (which is intangible/information).">data</a> (observations about the various people that are present), compare this with what you know about your friend (i.e. the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identity</a> about your friend that you <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owns</a>), and when you find a match, you will have identified your friend.

<p>Similar to before, this identification process is (also) said to fail if an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a> is selected that is not the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/subject" hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc.">subject</a> of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity" hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity).">partial identity</a> that you were looking for.

<p>In the above examples, we tacitly assumed that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p>In many contexts, this assumption does not hold.

In IT-contexts, an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agent</a> could be a web server, or a mobile app. In administrative contexts of an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization" hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives.">organization</a> (which could also be IT-contexts with web server and other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agents</a>), you could also encounter human <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agents</a> that are tasked with identification.</p>
<p>In any such cases, an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agent</a> that performs identification, must have access to the relevant subset of its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal&#x27;s</a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a>, that is: to a representation thereof that it is able to interpret as intended by its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a>.</p>
<p>Such representations can come in many forms. In a human administrative context, such representations can be stored in e.g. customer and/or supplier relation management systems, employee registrations, etc., which may be paper-based (in a file cabinet), or electronic (in a database). Typically for IT-contexts, this would also include user registrations, that hold accounts for the users. The subset of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/attribute" hovertext="Attribute (of an Entity): Data, that represents a characteristic that a Party (the Owner of the attribute) has attributed to an Entity (which is the Subject of that attribute).">attributes</a> that one can find a such a registration should have been chosen such that the various records therein are fit for purpose, which means that any <a href="/framework/docs/terms/action" hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context.">action</a> that an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agent</a> of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owner</a> of that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/data" hovertext="Data: something (tangible) that can be used to communicate a meaning (which is intangible/information).">data</a> must execute, can find the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/data" hovertext="Data: something (tangible) that can be used to communicate a meaning (which is intangible/information).">data</a> it needs for that task in one of its registrations.</p>
