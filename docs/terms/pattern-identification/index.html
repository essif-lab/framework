However, if we want to use these terms for our <a href="/framework/docs/essifLab-objectives">purposes</a>, their definition must be much more precise, particularly because we want to use them in IT-contexts. Lets show this by example.</p><p>Here, we discuss <a hovertext="Identify: an Act, by or on behalf of a Party, that results in the selection of either (a) a single Partial identity that the party Owns, given some (observed or received) data, or (b) a single Entity from a given set of entities that is the Subject of a specified Partial identity that the party Owns." href="/framework/docs/terms/identify">identification</a> in a way that we expect to be useful in IT-contexts (or non-IT, but still administrative contexts). Basically, two things are needed:</p><p>First, identification of an <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a> is similar to recognizing that <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a>.

Humans and Organizations are the typical examples." href="/framework/docs/terms/party">party</a>), identification is determining whether or not the <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples." href="/framework/docs/terms/party">party</a> <a hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity." href="/framework/docs/terms/owner">owns</a> a <a hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity)." href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity">partial identity</a> of which that <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a> is the <a hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc." href="/framework/docs/terms/subject">subject</a>. When the entity isn&#x27;t recognized (identified), then a <a hovertext="Partial identity (of an Entity): all Knowledge that a specific Party (= the Owner of the partial identity) has about that Entity (= the &#x27;Subject&#x27; of the partial identity)." href="/framework/docs/terms/partial-identity">partial identity</a> may be created that has this <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a> as its <a hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc." href="/framework/docs/terms/subject">subject</a>.</p><p>Second, identification of an <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a> is similar to pointing/singling out the <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a>.
