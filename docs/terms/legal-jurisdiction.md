### Short Description
A **Legal Jurisdiction** is a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% tha tis governed/operated by a governmental body.

The %%Jurisdictions pattern|pattern-jurisdiction%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose
We need the term **legal jurisdiction** because it is common practice for people and organizations to explicitly want to comply with applicable laws and regulations, where it is explicitly implied that these are the rules of a legal system that is governed by a governmental body. Introducing this term allows us to both generically reason about %%jurisdictions|jurisdiction%% (which is helpful to design e.g. SSI infrastructure) and also communicate about jurisdictions that have a governmental (legal) status.
