### Short Description
**Compliance management** is the process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific [party](@) for the purpose of [managing](@) its [compliance objectives](@).

In its core, [compliance management](@) is a [management](@) process like any other. It can be set apart because the [actors](@) that do the work will need to have [knowledge](@) about the relevant laws, policies and regulations (for regulatory [compliance](@)), and/or relevant standards such as ISO 9001 or ISO 27001 (for certification), or other relevant rules, requirements and other normative frameworks.

Part of [compliance management](@) is to determine the [compliance objectives](@) that state which [entities](@) are in scope, and what the normative frameworks are that each of them must comply with. Compliance with a [normative framework](@) is typically established by an (independent) auditor, that uses an [assessment framework](@) to evaluate the extent to which the party complies with the requirements of the [normative framework](@).

### Purpose
The purpose of having compliance-management set apart from the more generic [management](@) is that it often requires the involvement of people or third party organizations that have appropriate legal and/or regulatory knowledge that is not required in other kinds of [management](@) processes.

### Criteria
A [compliance management](@) process (of a [party](@)) is a [management](@)-process that is run by (or on behalf of) that [party](@), where the [objectives](@) that are managed pursue the state of affairs in which specific [entities](@) that the [party](@) controls (which can also be that [party](@) itself) comply with a specified set of requirements.
