<p>Informal <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mandate" hovertext="Mandate: a right or duty that one Party (the Mandator) has granted to another Party or Employee (the Mandatee) for executing a specific (set of) Actions in the name of, and under responsibility/accountability of, this (first) Party.">mandates</a> typically do not come with assurances and are usually not registered.

<p>Particularly in governmental, policing and judicial settings, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mandate" hovertext="Mandate: a right or duty that one Party (the Mandator) has granted to another Party or Employee (the Mandatee) for executing a specific (set of) Actions in the name of, and under responsibility/accountability of, this (first) Party.">mandates</a> will be formal because the ability to establish their existence is necessary as part of chains of evidence. Such <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mandate" hovertext="Mandate: a right or duty that one Party (the Mandator) has granted to another Party or Employee (the Mandatee) for executing a specific (set of) Actions in the name of, and under responsibility/accountability of, this (first) Party.">mandates</a> may also (need to) be registered so that third parties can check their  existence, the extent of rights and/or duties that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mandate" hovertext="Mandate: a right or duty that one Party (the Mandator) has granted to another Party or Employee (the Mandatee) for executing a specific (set of) Actions in the name of, and under responsibility/accountability of, this (first) Party.">mandatee</a> has been granted (i.e. what it can and cannot do under the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mandate" hovertext="Mandate: a right or duty that one Party (the Mandator) has granted to another Party or Employee (the Mandatee) for executing a specific (set of) Actions in the name of, and under responsibility/accountability of, this (first) Party.">mandate</a>), and obtain assurances to its rightful issuance (the issuer of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mandate" hovertext="Mandate: a right or duty that one Party (the Mandator) has granted to another Party or Employee (the Mandatee) for executing a specific (set of) Actions in the name of, and under responsibility/accountability of, this (first) Party.">mandate</a> must have the same right or duty as is <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mandate" hovertext="Mandate: a right or duty that one Party (the Mandator) has granted to another Party or Employee (the Mandatee) for executing a specific (set of) Actions in the name of, and under responsibility/accountability of, this (first) Party.">mandated</a>, as well as the right to <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mandate" hovertext="Mandate: a right or duty that one Party (the Mandator) has granted to another Party or Employee (the Mandatee) for executing a specific (set of) Actions in the name of, and under responsibility/accountability of, this (first) Party.">mandate</a> that right or duty.</p>

For example <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OAuth access tokens</a>, or other kinds of permissions are <a href="/framework/docs/terms/mandate" hovertext="Mandate: a right or duty that one Party (the Mandator) has granted to another Party or Employee (the Mandatee) for executing a specific (set of) Actions in the name of, and under responsibility/accountability of, this (first) Party.">mandates</a> for designated IT components (that act on behalf of some <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.
