### Short Description
A **Data Collector Policy** is a %%digital policy|digital-policy%% that enables an operational %%Data Collector component|data-collector%% to function according to the rules of its %%Policy Governor|policy-governor%%.

### Criteria
A **Data Collector Policy** is a %%digital policy|digital-policy%% that enables an operational %%Data Collector component|data-collector%% to function according to the rules, working-instructions and other guidance of its %%Policy Governor|policy-governor%%.
