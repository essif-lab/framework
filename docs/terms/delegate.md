### Short Description
A **delegate** is the transferral of [ownership](@) of one or more [obligations](@) (duties) of a [party](@) (the [delegator](@)), including the associated accountability, to another [party](@) (the [delegatee](@)), including the associated accountability, to another [party](@) (the [delegatee](@)). Doing so has several consequences:

- the [delegatee](@), as the new [owner](@), is autonomous and must therefore be expected (or: is free) to realize such [obligations](@) as it sees fit.
- since the results associated with these [obligation](@) continue to be consumed by others (third [parties](@)), the [delegatee](@) should - in its own way - ensure that they are/remain fit for the purpose(s) that these other [parties](@) need them to serve.

The transferral of [ownership](@) of an [obligation](@) differs from having a [party](@) produce the expected results as in the latter case, the [governance](@) of the [obligation](@) is not transferred.

[Delegates](@) are subject to the [legal system](@) of a [jurisdiction](@), which has the rules and constraints that specify what can(not) be done with them. Thus, [delegated](@) [obligations](@) are duties that are enforced using the means that its [jurisdiction](@) applies for that. The same goes in case of conflicts that concern [delegates](@). Also, [jurisdictions](@) may themselves specify [delegates](@), or templates for [delegates](@) that e.g. only require the [delegator](@) and [delegatee(s)](@) to be filled in.

While a [party](@) is usually free to [delegate](@) its [obligations](@), it may result in 'mismatches' of corresponding [expectations](@) of other [parties](@) - see the section **[Matching](pattern-governance-and-management#matching)** of the [Governance and Management pattern](pattern-governance-and-management@).


### Purpose
The purpose of (formal and/or explicit) [delegates](@) is that it enables [parties](@) to establish whether or not [parties](@) that have a specific [action(s)](@) executed, are entitled to do so.

### Criterion
A **delegate** is the transferral of [ownership](@) of one or more [obligations](@) of a [party](@) (the [delegator](@)), including the associated accountability, to another [party](@) (the [delegatee](@)), including the associated accountability, to another [party](@) (the [delegatee](@)), which implies that the [delegatee](@) can realize such [obligations](@) as it sees fit.

### Examples

Here's a translation of a [Dutch text](https://www.vijverbergadvocaten.nl/bestuursrecht/algemeen-bestuursrecht/mandaat-delegatie-en-volmacht) that explains [delegation](@): *"If an administrative body transfers its power to take certain decisions to another administrative body, this is referred to as delegation. An administrative body can only delegate a power if the law allows it. The administrative body that transfers a power through delegation can no longer exercise this power itself. The administrative body that has been transferred the authority exercises this authority in its own name and under its own responsibility. He is therefore legally responsible for that exercise, and thus also the defendant in objection or appeal against a decision taken on the basis of the delegated power."*

### Notes

The main difference between a [mandate](@) and a [delegate](@) is that under a [mandate](@), responsibility/accountability is not transferred to the [mandatee](@), whereas under a [delegate](@) the responsibility/accountability is also transferred.
