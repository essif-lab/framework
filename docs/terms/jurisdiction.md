### Short Description
A **Jurisdiction** is the composition of a (non-empty) set of %%objectives|objective%%, one %%scope|scope%%, one %%legal system|legal-system%% and one %%party|party%% (called the %%Governor of the Jurisdiction|jurisdiction-governor%%) that operates the legal system within that scope. While most people are familiar with what we call %%legal jurisdictions|legal-jurisdiction%%, please observe that %%organizations|organization%% habitually will have rules (business policies) in place, enforce them (to some extent), and have ways of resolving conflicts, and therefore qualify as a jurisdiction. Specifically, multi-national organizations are known to govern multiple jurisdictions, aliging the scopes with the scopes of other (often legal) jurisdictions for the purpose of preventing situations in which conflicting rules apply, which would lead to many effort-intensive conflict-resolution cases.

The %%Jurisdictions pattern|pattern-jurisdiction%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)jurisdictions is a very generic enabler for us to tell which rules (laws, policies, guidelines, etc.) will apply in which situations, which %%party|party%% governs and enforces these rules, and where we should look to resolve any conflicts.

### Criteria
the composition of one %%scope|scope%%, one %%legal system|legal-system%% and one %%party|party%% that operates the legal system within that scope.

### Notes
The case can be made for Nature to qualify as a jurisdiction, postulating that this jurisdiction has a universal scope, its %%party|party%% would be 'Nature' itself (which can be argued to qualify as a %%party|party%%), and the %%legal system|legal-system%% that Nature operates are the 'laws of nature' (which Nature defines, enforces and settles disputes in). If one adopts this view, then people become (natural) %%owners|owner%% of e.g. %%assertions|assertion%%, their %%knowledge|knowledge%% etc. Also, natural resources (e.g. rivers) would be %%legal entities|legal-entity%% in that jurisdiction, since they are 'known, and recognized to exist' by Nature.
