### Governance
<!--This section identifies the organizational body (Jurisdiction) that governs the scope. Optionally, a reference to the governance framework/procedures may be made.-->
The [eSSIF-Lab project](https://essif-lab.eu/) governs the terminology within this scope, according to the procedures mentioned in the [eSSIF-Lab Framework](https://essif-lab.pages.grnet.gr/framework/docs/terminology/).

### Objectives/Issues
<!--State the purpose for having the scope in terms of objectives that are aimed for and/or issues that are to be addressed.-->
Contributors to and users of eSSIF-Lab come from various backgrounds. Their culture may not be Western. English may not be their native tongue. They may be experts in non-technological topics. Working with one another presumes a setting where participants have some level of shared understanding. Often, sharing one's understanding at a superficial level suffices. Other situations require that underlying concepts are shared in a more in-depth fashion. It's like cars: people buying, selling, or driving cars do not need in-depth shared knowledge about cars, whereas (maintenance or construction) engineers or liability lawyers need to share a deeper knowledge of how cars do (or do not) work.

We expect to see situations of "language confusion", i.e. in which people use words or phrases, the intension (not: intention) of which differs from the interpretation of some listeners/readers. Sometimes a casual glance at a dictionary or glossary is the solution. In other cases, deeper understanding matters, e.g. in when drafting specifications or contracts. Then we need more than a set of definitions.

The Concepts and Terminology part of eSSIF-Lab aims helps eSSIF-Lab community participants understand one another at whatever level of precision they need.

### Scope URI
<!--Optionally specify the URI by which this scope may be identified-->

### Inclusions

In case of collisions, this scope MUST provide a means to resolve such conflicts without modifying anything in included scopes. For eSSIF-Lab, we include `essifLabTerminology`-->
