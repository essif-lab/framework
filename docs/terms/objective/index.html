<p>An <strong>Objective</strong> is something toward which a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> (its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owner</a>) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action). Typically, the realization of an objective can be observed in terms of results, e.g. products that have been produced, services that are being provided, a situation or state (e.g. happiness) that has been continued etc. A <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> that has an objective does not necessarily produce these results itself; it may also seek to realize them in order to use (consume) them - thus, production and consumption of results are the two different perspectives from which an objective can be perceived.</p>
<p>The <a href="/framework/docs/terms/ownership" hovertext="Ownership (of an Entity over another in a Jurisdiction): a relationship between two Entities in which one of them (called the Owner) has legal, rightful or natural rights and/or duties to enjoy, dispose of, and control the other (called the Owned).">ownership</a> of the objective is implied: it is the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owns</a> the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> of which it is a part. This <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> also (consciously or unconsciously) creates, maintains and enforces the rules (rights and duties) that determine how the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> is pursued (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/management" hovertext="Management: the act or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives.">managed</a> and/or <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for.">governed</a>). And it will (consciously or unconsciously) have a means in place to resolve any (internal) disputes that may arise. Thus, the  <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

Typically, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> will also have <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-objective" hovertext="Risk objective (of a Party): an Objective, owned by that Party, that aims to reach and maintain a state of affairs in which the Risks associated with a specific set of its Objectives become, and/or remain, acceptable.">objectives</a>, the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management" hovertext="Risk management: a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific Party for the purpose of Managing the Risks that it Owns (thereby realizing specific Risk Objectives).">pursuit</a> of which ensures that the overall (residual) risk they bear becomes and remains acceptable.</p>
<p><a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">Objectives</a> cannot be shared, i.e.: have more than one <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owner</a>. If that were possible, then all <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owners</a> would necessarily, at any point in time, agree e.g. to whether or not the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> was realized, what <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk" hovertext="Risk (of a Party&#x27;s Objective): the effects that uncertainty (i.e. a lack of information, understanding or knowledge of events, their consequences or likelihoods) can have on the intended realization of that Party&#x27;s Objective.">risks</a> are associated with it, etc., In other words: when one changes its mind (i.e. changes some attribute of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objective</a> in its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a>), the same change would <em>necessarily</em> take place in the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> of all other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owners</a>, which contradicts with the postulate that every <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> has full autonomy over its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>In order to communicate its objectives, a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> typically uses a text - a description of its intention, the aim, the goal, etc. In practice, people are known to confuse this description with the objective itself, which may cause them to think that two parties shared the same objective because these parties happen to use the same descriptive text. As mentioned before, that&#x27;s not possible. However, it may be the case that two parties each have an objective that is similar to a very high degree. However, as each party can autonomously change the descriptive text, (the specification of) the results and any other attributes, it is obvious that what might seem to be the same objective is actually a set of (very) similar objectives.</p>
<p>There are various ways for <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> to come to grips with specifying and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management" hovertext="Management: the act or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives.">managing</a> (or <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for.">governing</a>) their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective" hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).">objectives</a>.
