Our world view is shaped by the distinctions that eSSIF-Lab makes as it classifies such entities into well-defined categories, each of which having specific characteristics.</p><p>One of the most fundamental categories is called <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples." href="/framework/docs/terms/party">party</a>. A party (typical examples of which are <a hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives." href="/framework/docs/terms/organization">organizations</a> (governments, enterprises) and individual human beings) is defined as an <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a> that manages and uses its own <a hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party." href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge">knowledge</a> autonomously. It is its own sovereign, i.e. within its <a hovertext="Scope of Control (of a Party): the extent of the area or subject matter that the Party controls." href="/framework/docs/terms/scope-of-control">scope of control</a>, everything is guided by its own, subjective <a hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party." href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge">knowledge</a>. This includes all decision making, execution of <a hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context." href="/framework/docs/terms/action">actions</a>, <a hovertext="Risk (of a Party&#x27;s Objective): the effects that uncertainty (i.e. a lack of information, understanding or knowledge of events, their consequences or likelihoods) can have on the intended realization of that Party&#x27;s Objective." href="/framework/docs/terms/risk">risks</a>, <a hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for." href="/framework/docs/terms/governance">governance</a>, etc., etc. We also postulate that every party has <a hovertext="Objective: Something toward which a Party (its Owner) directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action)." href="/framework/docs/terms/objective">objectives</a> that it pursues. A large part of its knowledge revolves about managing these objectives (which includes <a hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for." href="/framework/docs/terms/governance">governance</a> and <a hovertext="Risk management: a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific Party for the purpose of Managing the Risks that it Owns (thereby realizing specific Risk Objectives)." href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management">risk management</a>) and making sure they get realized.</p><p>While parties are their own (self-)sovereigns and in principle can do as they please, they live in a universe with many other parties, that are also &#x27;self-sovereigns&#x27;. This means that they need to come to terms with one another as they have interactions with one another that may influence the <a hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party." href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge">knowledge</a> of the participating parties, and have other consequences as well. Such <a hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)." href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction">transactions</a> between parties is not only one of the focal points of this <a hovertext="Framework (Conceptual): A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality." href="/framework/docs/terms/framework">framework</a> (see further down), but the reason we have created this <a hovertext="Framework (Conceptual): A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality." href="/framework/docs/terms/framework">framework</a>.</p><p>Another fundamental category is called <a hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations." href="/framework/docs/terms/actor">actor</a>, which is defined as an <a hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist." href="/framework/docs/terms/entity">entity</a> that can act (do things). It is important to note that while some entity classes (e.g. human beings) qualify as both actors and parties, other entity classes do not (e.g. <a hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives." href="/framework/docs/terms/organization">organizations</a>, or robots). As an actor does something (executing an <a hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context." href="/framework/docs/terms/action">action</a>), it uses the <a hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party." href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge">knowledge</a> of one specific <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples." href="/framework/docs/terms/party">party</a> as the main guidance for executing that action (it may use knowledge of other parties as well). We say that the actor executes that action on behalf of that party. Actors may execute different actions on behalf of different parties. It is a particular contribution of this <a hovertext="Framework (Conceptual): A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality." href="/framework/docs/terms/framework">framework</a> that using it allows one to determine which actor executes what action on behalf of what party. This is particularly relevant in the context of two interacting/transacting parties.

This makes its results particularly relevant for administrative organizations such as governmental bodies, financial institutions and the like. However, <em>every</em> party will have use-cases in which it needs to (digitally) interact with other parties, so for them, the eSSIF-Lab work is relevant as well.</p><p>A party usually cannot realize its objectives on its own.
