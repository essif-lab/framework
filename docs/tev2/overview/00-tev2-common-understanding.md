# Enabling a Common Understanding in a Community

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

In order for a [community](@) (e.g. a workgroup, taskforce, project/product team, department, etc.) to realize its [objectives](@), it is beneficial that its members have a common set of the ideas, [concepts](@) and other [knowledge artifacts](@) that are relevant for realizing these [objectives](@). The ability to realize such a common understanding, and to demonstrate that this is actually the case, is a critical capability for success.

The Terminology Engine (v2) is a set of specifications and tools that (technically) facilitate such capabilities, by recognizing that each [community](@) wants (and needs):
- its own [terminology](@) that can develop over time (producing different versions);
- to autonomously [define](@) specific [terms](@), create its particular documentation for its [concepts](@) or other [knowledge artifacts](@);
- to 'import' (borrow, include, use) specific [terms](@) that are defined by other [communities](@);
- to make its own [terminologies](@) available for other [communities](@) to 'import';
- to generate tangible artifacts such as [glossaries](@), [dictionaries](@) and other documentation (specifications, white papers, etc.) that actually use the [terminology](@) as committed to by (each member of) the [community](@).

This technical support must, however, be complemented with methods that a [community](@) will actually use to produce and maintain its [terminology](@). <mark>We need to decide whether or not to provide guidance for that as well.</mark>

:::info Editor's note
([Agredo-Delgado, et. al., 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-021-09326-z))[^1] have tested a process for constructing a shared understanding in computer-supported collaborative work, where the construction part consists of 4 steps:
1. each group member acquires an individual understanding of the subject;
2. each group member exposes his/her ideas and the others actively listen to them;
3. the group refines, builds or modifies the original ideas;
4. the differences of interpretation between the group members are dealt with in a constructive fashion, through arguments and clarifications.
