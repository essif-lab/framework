# TEv2 - Purpose

:::danger This page is deprecated.
The current TEv2 website is located at https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/overview/overview-tev2
:::

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

The Terminology Engine (v2) is a set of specifications and tools that caters for the creation and maintenance (i.e. [curation](@)) of [terminologies](@), as well as for its subsequent use in publications of different types (e.g. websites, whitepapers) and formats (e.g. html, LaTeX), as appropriate for different, individual [scopes](@).

The main objective of [TEv2](@) is to provide support to [communities](@) that actively seek to [understand one another](/docs/tev2/overview/tev2-common-understanding), first within the [community](@) itself, but also across [communities](@) that also use [TEv2](@).

In practice, this means that [TEv2](@) provides tools and mechanisms that:

1. help [readers](@) of publications (that were generated with [TEv2](@) tools) to understand the [terms](@) that are used therein, in the way that the [authors](@) have intended (rather than interpreting such [terms](@) in their own way);
2. facilitating [authors](@) to write and publish texts where terms can be referenced to their intended meaning, within, and across [scopes](@);
3. supporting [authors](@), [readers](@) and other stakeholders to such publications as they seek to create and further develop a [terminology](@) that they can commit to (within a specific [scope](@)), which we expect to also help develop insights in their subject matter of that [scope](@)).

These contributions are what so-called [curators](@) of the [scope](@) seek to deliver. They are the ones that make sure that there is a [location](scopedir@) where people can contribute to the development of the [terminology](@) of a [scope](@), and tools are installed and operational that enable [authors](@) to use them as they publish their documents. [Curators](@) have their own [manual](/docs/tev2/manuals/curator).

The [eSSIF-Lab website](/docs/essifLab) already shows the first ideas of what that might look like (popups on [terms](@) showing their [definition](@)).
