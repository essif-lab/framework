TEv2 is a tool for [curating](@) [terminology](@)-related data from the perspective of a single [scope](@). Installation comprises
- setting up, or appointing an (online) directory that will serve as a [scope directory](@);
- creating a [Scope Administration File (SAF)](tev2-spec-saf), and providing the configuration of the [scope](@) and its [terminology](@);
- installing the [tev2-toolbox](tev2-toolbox);
- integrating the [tools](tev2-toolbox) with other tools, such as a CI/CD pipeline on github or gitlab, static site generators such as [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction), etc. See also: [Using the Tools](tev2-toolbox-use).

### Structure of Scope Directories

Depending on the other tooling that is going to be used, a [scope directory](@) has to be specified that is part of the (online) directory in which the [terminology](@) has to be used. The [scope's](@) [scope administration file (SAF)](saf@) specifies whatever needs to be administered for that [scope](@); this file is maintained by the [curators](@) of the scope (using a regular text editor).

[Curators](@) must also specify a location (directory) within the [scope directory](@) where [glossaries](@) are being maintained. This location holds the [Glossary Definition Files (GDFs)](gdf@) that are used to generate [glossaries](@) for different purposes, as needed. Also, this directory will (by default) contain the [glossaries](@) that are generated.

### Integrating Scope Directories and Third Party Rendering Tools

Terminological artifacts are intended to also be used by/within third party rendering tools, such as [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction), or LaTex
