:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

One purpose of the Terminology Engine (v2) is to provide terminological support for people that author documentation, specifications, whitepapers, articles and the like. This document provides guidance for authors to make use of that support.
