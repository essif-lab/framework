The **Glossary Generation tool ([GGT](tev2-toolbox-mrgt))** generates a Machine Readable [Glossary](@) ([MRG](@)), that contains/renders the [terminology](@) of a specific [scope](@). The [MRG](@) of a [Scope](@) contains all [terminology](@)-related data that other tools need.

In order to do so, [GGT](tev2-toolbox-mrgt) expects the [SAF](@) of the [scope](@) from within which it is being called, to be available. This [SAF](@) suffices to generate a (machine readable) [glossary](@) of the [scope](@), as it specifies:
- the [terminology](@) of that [scope](@), i.e. the set of [terms](@) that it is comprised of;
- the location of the directory where the [MRG](@) is to be created, and
- the name that the file that will contain the [MRG](@) contents.

The [@GGT] can also be passed a [Glossary Definition File (GDF)](gdf@), that specifies how an [MRG](@) can be converted into some other format. Such a format could either be an intermediate format that other tools (such as Docusaurus, or a LaTeX renderer) would further process, or it could produce a file that is automatically published on some human browsable website.

a [Glossary Definition File (GDF)](tev2-spec-gdf) to be (implicitly or explicitly) specified, that contains a specification of the [terminology](@) of a specific [scope](@), and further instructions regarding the rendering of its [terms](@) (<Mark>this part needs to be worked out some more - perhaps we should just generate MRG's, and do the other glossaries with a separate, extensible toolset</Mark>).

In order to do so, [GGT](tev2-toolbox-mrgt) expects the [SAF](@) and the [MRG](@) of the [scope](@) from within which it is being called, to be available. The [MRG](@) is used to resolve all links to [terms](@) that are part of the [terminology](@) of this [scope](@). The [SAF](@) is used to locate the [MRG's](@) of any (other) [scope](@) whose [scopetag](@) is used as part of a [reference](term-ref@) that needs to be resolved.

The [GGT](#ggt) first creates an [MRG](#mrg) (which does the 'heavy lifting'), and from that, a [HRG](#hrg) will be created. Different [HRGs](#hrg), i.e. different human-readable renderings of the [terminology](@) may be created from the same [MRG](#mrg).+

### Creating an MRG

Creating an [MRG](#mrg) works as follows:
- Create an initial set of glossary entries, i.e. one for every [term](@) (from [scopes](scope@) other than the one we create the MRG for) that is selected per the specifications in the [GDF](#gdf). A glossary entry is constructed by interpreting the [term file](@essiflab) that defines the [term](@), and producing the glossary entry structure as defined for [MRGs](#mrg). Note that this can only be done for [term files](term-file@essiflab) that have a syntax that is supported by the [GGT](#ggt). If the created glossary entry has an `id` that is the same as the `id`-field of an existing glossary-entry, that glossary entry will be discarded (meaning that the newly created glossary entry  'overrides' the existing one).
- Add a glossary entry for every [term](@) that is defined in the [scope](@) from which the [GGT](#ggt) is called, again removing any existing glossary-entry that has an `id`-field that is the same as a newly added one.
- Perform completeness and consistency checks on the set of glossary entries, to ensure that
  - every glossary entry is [identifiable](identify@essiflab) by its `id`-field;
  - every element in the `formphrases`-list of a glossary entry does not occur as an element in the `formphrases`-list of another glossary entry;
- Sort the glossary entries according to their `id` field;
- Add header/meta data as needed as specified for [MRGs](#mrg).

For example, consider the [term](@) `curate` as defined in the [CTWG terms wiki](https://github.com/trustoverip/ctwg/wiki/curate). The wiki-page would be interpreted, which would lead to the following (machine readable) glossary entry:
~~~
  id: concept-curate
  scopetag: ctwg
  termtype: concept
  termid: curate
  grouptags:
  date: 20211123
  versiontag: 9
  commit:
  formphrases: curate, curates, curated, curation
  status: proposed
  termname: curate
  synonyms: curation
  glossaryText: To evolve [concept](@) and [term](@) data in the direction of greater quality and richer content within a specific [scope](@).
  hoverText: Curate: to evolve concept and term data in the direction of greater quality and richer content within a specific scope.
  url: https://github.com/trustoverip/ctwg/wiki/curate
~~~

Glossaries are generated at a default location, which for ToIP is `http://trustoverip.github.io/<terms-community>/glossary`, where `<terms-community>` is the name of the [terms-community](@) that [curates](curate) the [terms](term@) in the [glossary](@).

The [GGT](#ggt) should log conditions that prevent it from properly

- parsing a source document (e.g. because it is not in the expected format);
- resolving `id`s, [scope tags](tag@), [group tags](tag@), or [version tags](tag@);
- writing the output (e.g. because it has no write-permission for the designated location);
- etc.;

and provide suggestions that help tool-operators to identify and fix any problems.

The [GGT](#ggt) should come with documentation that enables developers to ascertain its correct functioning (e.g. by using a test set of files, test scripts that exercise its parameters, etc.), and also enables them to deploy the tool in a git repo and author/modify CI-pipes to use that deployment.

### Creating a HRG

:::info Editor's note
A specification is needed for the creation of a (simple) HRG (from an existing MRG).
Any [term refs](term-ref@) need to be properly resolved.
Titles of term entries may want to link to the original resource from which it was derived.
Choice bars (e.g. `[ A B C D .... Z ]` may need to be inserted here and there).
Meta-data (group tags, the scopetag of the scope where it was defined, contributors, versions, dates, etc.) may need to be included.
There must be some license notification.
