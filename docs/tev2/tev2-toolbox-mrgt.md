:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

The **Machine Readable Glossary generation Tool ([MRGT](@))** generates a Machine Readable Inventory (that we call a Machine Readable Glossary or [MRG](@)) for (a specific version of) the [terminology](@) of a specific [scope](@) into a specific, well-defined [format](tev2-spec-mrg). This Inventory is not a [glossary](@) because it contains so-called [MRG entries](@) for every [term](@) in that [scope](@), and such [terms](@) may represent [terminological artifacts](@) of various kinds, such as [concepts](@), but also e.g., [mental models](pattern@) and [use cases](@). We choose to maintain the [term](@) "Machine Readable Glossary" ([MRG](@)), because most of us would view it - initially, at least - as a list of [terms](@) and their [definitions](@).

The (newly generated) [MRG](@) is meant to be processed by the other tools in the [toolbox](tev2-toolbox), regardless of whether such tools are called from within the context of another [scope](@). As it contains every [term](@) that is used in the [scope](@), and includes the relevant meta-data, it serves as the single, authoritative source of that [scope's](@) [terminology](@).

## Generating an MRG

As input, the [MRGT](@) is provided a [SAF](@), is pointed to the particular entry in its [`versions` section](tev2-spec-saf#terminology) that specifies (a specific version of) a [terminology](@). This section not only includes meta-data for that [terminology](@), but also a set of 'term selection criteria' instructions, that are used to [construct](terminology-construction) the [terminology](@).

The [MRG](@) is then created as follows (starting with an empty file):

1. The [MRG](@) `terminology` section is created, by copying relevant fields from the appropriate `versions` element in the [SAF](@).
2. Then the [terminology construction](terminology-construction) takes place, which can be thought of as constructing a set of tuples `{ [termid, term, grouptags] }`, where `termid` [identifies](@) the meaning of the [term](@), `term` is the (humanly recognizable) [word or phrase](term@) that represents this meaning, and `grouptags` is a set of [grouptags](@) that the tuple is associated with.
3. For every tuple in this set, an [MRG entry](@) is created, and added to the [MRG](@) under construction. Note that the structure of each such [entry](mrg-entry@) depends on the type of the [terminological artifact](@) that the [term](@) represents.
4. the result is put at the location as specified by the [SAF](@), and the [SAF](@) itself is updated as necessary.

### Creating an MRG Entry

An [MRG entry](@) is either a literal copy of an (existing) [MRG entry](@) that is found in an [MRG](@) that lives in another [scope](@), or it is constructed from a [curated text](@). [Curated texts](@) live in files in (one of the subdirectories of) the directory specified in the `curatedir` field of hte [SAF](@).

Constructing an [MRG entry](@) from a [curated text](@) is done by first creating the fields that are common for all [MRG entries](@), and then adding fields that are specific for the type of [terminological artifact](@) that the [MRG entry](@) describes.

The common fields get their values according to the following table:

| Field          | Value(s) that are assigned to the fields |
| -------------- | :---------- |
| `scopetag`     | `scopetag` field in the `scope` section of the [SAF](@). |
| `id`           | `id` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `termtype`     | `termtype` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `termid`       | `termid` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `formphrases`  | `formphrases` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `grouptags`    | `grouptags` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `status`       | `status` field of the [curated text](@). If that value is not present, and the [SAF](@) has a non-empty `statuses` field in its `scope` section, then the value of the first element of that `statuses` field is used. |
| `created`      | `created` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `updated`      | `updated` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `vsntag`       | `vsntag` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `commit`       | `commit` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `contributors` | `contributors` field of the [curated text](@). |
| `locator`      | path, relative to `scopedir`/`curatedir`/, of the [curated text](@). |
| `navurl`       | <Mark>TBD</Mark>. |
| `headingids`   | The [curated file](@) is scanned for [markdown headings](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings) (using the syntax with `#`-signs rather than the [alternate syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#alternate-syntax)) and/or [heading ids](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#linking-to-heading-ids), and each heading or heading-id that is found is added to the list of headingids in this field. |

## Exceptions, Warnings, and Logging

The general principle is that the [MRGT](@) helps its users to do their jobs. This means that errors that terminate the processing are limited to the max, that warnings (perhaps at different 'levels' of detail/severity) are given output whenever possible (yet may be limited by command-line options), and that texts are tailored for the envisaged users of the tool.

The [MRGT](@) logs conditions that prevent it from properly:

- obtaining the [scopedir](@) from a [scopetag](@);
- parsing a [curated text](@) (e.g. because it is not in the expected format);
- resolving `id`s, [scope tags](@), [group tags](@), or [version tags](@);
- writing the output (e.g. because it has no write-permission for the designated location);
- etc.;

Also, the [MRGT](@) provides suggestions that help tool-operators ([curators](@)) to not only identify, but also fix any problems.

The [MRGT](@) comes with documentation that enables developers to ascertain its correct functioning (e.g. by using a test set of files, test scripts that exercise its parameters, etc.), and also enables them to deploy the tool in a git repo and author/modify CI-pipes to use that deployment.
