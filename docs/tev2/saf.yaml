# This is a Scope Administration File that can be used in conjunction with TEv2.
#
# The first section defines meta-data concerning the scope and its terminology,
# as well as data that enables interactions with its curators.
#
terminology:
  scopetag: tev2 # identifier that curators have determined for this terminology
  website: https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/tev2/tev2-overview # home page of the terminology
  slack: https://trustoverip.slack.com/archives/C01BBNGRPUH # slack channel for discussions
  issues: https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/issues # issues reporting and handling
  curator: # contacting individual curators

  # `dateformat` is a (PCRE) regex that can be used to interpret (parse) dates and date-times
  # as they are used within this scope, the result of which shows up as named capturing groups.
  # As an example, we specify the regex for ISO 8601 date(time)s, which is explained at
  # https://www.debuggex.com/r/7AhSyBzuBvuzYn52.
  dateformat: (?P<year>\d{4})-?(?P<month>\d{2})-?(?P<day>\d{2})(?:T?(?P<hour>\d{2}):?(?P<minute>\d{2}):?(?P<second>\d{2})(?:\.(?P<fraction>\d+))?(?P<tzone>[+-]\d{2}:\d{2})?)?

# The following section specifies data that helps tools to find various data:
# - of the scope itself, and
# - of scopes that contain data that needs to be used/imported.
#   For such 'third party scopes', only the URL of their scope-directories is needed
#   as any other data can be found from the SOF that is located there.
#
scopes:  # The first scopetag should be about the terminology administrated by this file
  - scopetags: # definition of (scope) tag(s) that are used within this scope to refer to a specific terminology
