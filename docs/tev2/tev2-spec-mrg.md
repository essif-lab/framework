:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction
:::

Every [scope](@) has (at least) one **Machine Readable Inventory**[^1] (that we call a **Machine Readable Glossary** or [MRG](@)), that renders the [terminology](@) of a specific [scope](@) into a specific, well-defined format that is described in this document. An [MRG](@) is meant to be used by the tools from the [toolbox](tev2-toolbox), e.g. for creating a [HRG](@), or to help resolve [term refs](@). A [scope](@) may have multiple [MRGs](@), each of which represents a specific version of its [terminology](@).

[^1]: The [MRG](@) is an Inventory rather than a [glossary](@), because it contains _all_ [terminological artifacts](@) that are [curated](@) within the [scope](@): apart from [terms](@), it also include e.g., [mental models](pattern@) and [use cases](@). We choose to maintain the [term](@) "Machine Readable Glossary" ([MRG](@)), because most of us would view it - initially, at least - as a list of [terms](@) and their [definitions](@).

## MRG structure

A Machine Readable Glossary (MRG) is a YAML (or JSON) file that has three sections:
- **`terminology`** specifies the characteristics of the [terminology](@) of the [scope](@). This includes the [scopetag](@) and [scopedir](@) of the [scope](@), as well as the license under which the contents of the [MRG](@) can be used.
- **`scopes`** specifies which (other) [scopes](@) are relevant to this [terminology](@). This includes the [scopetag](@) and [scopedir](@) of any such [scope](@).
- **`entries`** contains an (unsorted) list of [MRG entries](@).

The following fields are defined for the sections `terminology`:

:::info Editor's note
The section below deviates from the design choices made for [SAFs](@), where the `scopedir` of the [scope](@) in which the [MRG](@) is defined is made part of the `scopes` section. We need to determine whether or not change either the [SAF](@) spec or the [MRG](@) spec or leave it as it is.
:::

| Name     | Req'd | Description |
| -------- | :---: | :---------- |
| `scopetag` | Y | [Scopetag](@) of the [scope](@) in which the [MRG](@) is defined. This is the [scopetag](@) that the [curators](@) of the [scope](@) have chosen for this [scope](@).<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `scopedir` | Y | URL that locates the [scope directory](@) associated with that [scope](@). |
| `license`  | n | Filename of the file that is located in `scopedir`, and that contains licensing data. |

The following fields are defined for the section `scopes`:

| Name     | Req'd | Description |
| -------- | :---: | :---------- |
| `scopetag` | Y | [Scopetag](@) of a third-party [scope](@), the [MRG](@) of which contains [MRG entries](@) that have been imported into the [MRG](@). This [scopetag](@) has been chosen by the [curators](@) of the [scope](@) of which the [MRG](@) is part, to refer to that particular third-party [scope](@). This [scopetag](@) may differ from the [scopetag](@) that the [curators](@) of that third-party [scope](@) have chosen for this [scope](@) <br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `scopedir` | Y | URL that locates the [scope directory](@) associated with that third-party [scope](@). |

## MRG Entries - Common Fields

An [MRG](@) consists of a list of [MRG entries](@), the purpose of which is that the various tools can find all data that is relevant for the purpose that such a tool serves.

[MRG entries](@) are typed, and each type has its own [MRG entry](@) structure. However, all [MRG entries](@) have a common set of fields, as follows:

| Name         | Req'd | Description |
| ------------ | :---: | :---------- |
| `scopetag`     | Y | [Tag](@) of the [scope](@) from which the [MRG entry](@) and its description are obtained. We need this because an [MRG](@) not only contains [terminological artifacts](@) that are defined in the [scope](@) itself, but also [terminological artifacts](@) that are defined in other [scopes](@). The `scopes` section in the [MRG](@) SHOULD contain a mapping between the `scopetag` and its associated [scope directory](@).<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `id`           | Y | Text that [identifies](@) the [MRG entry](@) within the context of the [MRG](@). Resolution of a [term ref](@) is done by matching the `id`-field of that [term ref](@) with the `id` fields of [MRG entries](@), and selecting the (single) [MRG entry](@) if a match is found. It is typical (but not required) that [terminological artifacts](@) of the type `concept`, `term` and `relation` have this `id` field identical to the `termid` field of the [MRG entry](@) if that does not result in ambiguities. For other `termtype`s, or in case of ambiguities, this field would typically be of the form `<termtype>-<termid>`, which would be `pattern-terminology` for the terminology-pattern.<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `termtype`     | Y | Text that [identifies](@) the kind of [terminological artifact](@) that this [MRG entry](@) refers to. Typical values would be `concept`, `relation`, `pattern` (or `mental-model`), `term` (or `alias`), or `usecase`.<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `termid`       | Y | Text that [identifies](@) an instance of the [terminological artifacts](@) of the type specified in the `termtype` field of this [MRG entry](@).<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `grouptags`    | n | List of [grouptags](@), each of which [identifies](@) a group of [terminological artifacts](@) of which the [terminological artifact](@) that this [curated text](@) describes, is a member.<br/>Must satisfy regex [`(?:\[\s*([a-z0-9_-]+)\s*(?:,\s*([a-z0-9_-]+))*\s*\])?`](https://www.debuggex.com/r/a51CXl1NzR3kwihT). |
| `created`      | n | Date at which of the [term](@)-related data was created, in the date format as used within this [scope](@). |
| `updated`      | n | Date at which of the [term](@)-related data was last modified, in the date format as used within this [scope](@). |
| `versiontag`   | n | Text that identifies the version of the [terminological artifact](@) that this [MRG entry](@) documents (not to be confused with the version of a [terminology](@) of which this [terminological artifact](@) is a part).<br/>Must satisfy regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`. |
| `commit`       | n | The (git/gitlab) commit hash of the latest update of the [terminological artifact's](@). |
| `contributors` | n | Text that shows (or refers to) the people that have contributed to the texts related to this term. |
| `formphrases`  | n | List of [texts](formphrase@) that the [TRRT](#trrt) can use to convert the `show text` parts of [term refs](@) into `id`s, for the purpose of accommodating plural forms (for nouns) or conjugate forms (for verbs).<br/>Must satisfy regex [`(?:\[\s*([a-z0-9_-{}]+)\s*(?:,\s*([a-z0-9_-{}]+))*\s*\])?`](https://www.debuggex.com/r/TZe27fzbJskMcjl8). |
| `status`       | n | Text that identifies the status of the term. ([Communities](@) of) [scopes](@) may specify values for this field. An example is the [status tags used by ToIP](https://github.com/trustoverip/concepts-and-terminology-wg/blob/master/docs/status-tags.md). |
| `locator`      | n | Text that identifies the file that holds the [curated text](@) of the [terminological artifact](@) that this [MRG entry](@) describes, relative to the [scopedir](@) that holds the [curated text](@). The full URL of the [curated text](@) is `scopedir`/`curatedir`/`locator`, where `scopedir` and `curatedir` can be found in the [SAF](@) (which is in the root of `scopedir`). |
| `headerids`    | n | List of texts that can be used as a [markdown 'heading-ids' field](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#linking-to-heading-ids) |

## MRG Entries - Type-specific fields

The [MRG](@) can hold [MRG entries](@) of different types, each of which has its particular set of fields to describe the [MRG entry](@).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="concept"
  values={[
    {label: 'Terms', value: 'term'},
    {label: 'Concepts', value: 'concept'},
    {label: 'Relations', value: 'relation'},
    {label: 'Mental Models', value: 'pattern'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="concept"><br/>

### Header fields for `termtype: concept`

[Concepts](@) are the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of [entities](@) (what makes [entities](@) in that class 'the same').
A good description - which would include a good [definition](@) - allows us to reason about everything in the class as if it were one thing. [Curated texts](@) of type `concept` intend to provide such descriptions. Also, they specify a default name ([term](@)) by which the class, as well as unidentified instances thereof, can be refered to.

The header fields that are specific for `concept`-type descriptions are as follows:

| Name         | Req'd | Description |
| ------------ | :---: | :---------- |
| `term`         | Y | Text that is used to [identify](@) the [concept](@) (in the context of the [MRG](@), and also to represent arbitrary instances of that [concept](@) in human readable documents, such as a [HRG](@).<br/>Example: 'terminological artifact'. |
| `fullterm`     | n | Text that can be used as the complete form of the text mentioned in the `term` field.<br/>Example: 'terminological artifact (of a scope)', or '(scoped) terminological artifact'. |
| `shorterm`     | n | Text that can be used as an abbreviated form of the text mentioned in the `term` field.<br/>Example: 'artifact'. |
| `synonyms`     | n | List of (optionally quoted) words and/or (quoted) phrases, that are considered to have the same meaning as the text specified in the `term` field. |
| `glossaryText` | Y | Text that can be used as the (raw) contents for the entry of this [term](@) in a human readable [glossary](@). Note that this text SHOULD be allowed to contain [term refs](@). |
| `hoverText`    | n | Text that can be used as the contents of a popup that shows as the [term](@) is rendered in a web browser and the [reader](@) hovers over the [term](@) with its mouse. |

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="term"><br/>

### Header fields for `termtype: term`

A [term](@) is a word or phrase that is used in a [scope](@) in a specific meaning, typically referring to a specific [concept](@), or a [relation](@) between [concepts](@). This meaning may deviate from the meanings that this word or phrase has in other [scopes](@), and in everyday language.

[Terms](@) do not generally need to be documented as a [curated text](@) when they are already specified as the default name in the [curated text](@) that describes the [concept](@), [relation](@), or other [terminological artifact](@). In specific cases, however, words or phrases need to be assigned to existing [curated texts](@), for example, a [scopetag](@) is a specialization of a [grouptag](@), and can hence be documented as (a specialization of) a [grouptag](@) that has the (additional) property of grouping all [terms](@) defined in the [scope](@) that it [identifies](@).

header fields for `term` termtypes need to be discussed.

### Header fields for `termtype: relation`

:::info Editor's note
This section needs to be discussed as `relation` is introduced as a new termtype.
:::

[Relations](@) are what associates [concepts](@) with one another. For example, the [concept](@) [terms community](@) and the [concept](@) [scope](@) are linked by the [relation](@) [curate](@), that signifies that instances (i.e. [entities](@) in the class) of [curators](@) may [curate](@) (instances of the class) [scope](@). Relations are typically modelled as (`subject`, `predicate`, `object`) triples. A [relation](@) typically has constraints, such as [multiplicities](@),[^2] but other constraints exist as well.

[^2]: The terms 'multiplicity' and 'cardinality' are often confused. In short: 'multiplicity' is at the (conceptual) class-level what 'cardinality' is at the instance level, and both use notations such as `0..1`, `1`, `0..*`, `*`, `1..*`, and `n..m`). Consider the relation [curates](@) (specified as "[terms community](@) - [0..1] --- [1..n] - [scope](@)"). The `[0..1]` and `[1..n]` are multiplicities. They signify that every [terms community](@) [curates](@) one or more [scopes](@), and every [scope](@) is curated by at most one [terms community](@) respectively. This sets constraints on the (operational) cardinalities, i.e. the number of elements that a particular [terms community](@) (e.g. `CTWG`) [curates](@) (that cardinality is `2`, becausse `CTWG` curates the [scopes](@) `ctwg` and `toip`).

A good description - which would include a good [definition](@) of the [relation](@) - allows us to reason about everything related to the [relation](@). [Curated texts](@) of type `relation` intend to provide such descriptions. Also, they specify a default name ([term](@)) by which the [relation](@), as well as unidentified instances thereof, can be refered to.

| Name      | Req'd | Description |
| --------- | :---: | :---------- |
| subject     | y | [concept](@) that the relation relates with the [concept](@) specified by `object`. If the relation is a so-called triple (i.e. a (`subject`, `predicate`, `object`)-relation, it is the `subject`. |
| object      | n | A [concept](@), or a data-variable, that the `subject` of the relation relates to.[^3] |
| pragma      | n | text, with placeholders for `subject` (and `object` if appropriate), that can be used to construct example sentences.[^4] |
| smult       | n | multiplicity associated with the `subject` [concept](@). If not specified, its value is `[0..n]`. |
| omult       | n | multiplicity associated with the `object`. If not specified, its value is `[0..n]`. |
| endo        | n | For [homogeneous relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_relation), i.e. relations where `subject` and `object` are the same, e.g. as in (_Person_, _is a parent of_, _Person_), [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_relation#Properties) may hold that are typical for endo relations, such as `reflexive`, `irreflexive`, `symmetric`, `asymmetric`, `antisymmetric`, `transitive`. |
| constraints | n | Comma separated list of texts, each of which specifies a constraint that the relation must always satisfy. |

[^3]: In a [relation](@) such as (_Person_, _loves_, _Person_), _Person_ is a ([concept](@)) class. However, in a [relation](@) such as (_Person_, _has lived_, _years_), _years_ is not a [concept](@) (idea), but a data-variable, that has a specific value, in this case a number (of years).

[^4]: For a [relation](@) (_[terms community](@)_, _[curates](@)_,  _[scope](@)_), a pragma could be "Terms community `subject` curates the scope '`object`'.", allowing the construction of phrases such as "Terms community CTWG curates scope 'ctwg'."

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pattern"><br/>

### Header fields for `termtype: pattern`

A [pattern](@) (also called [mental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model) or [conceptual model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model)) captures a limited set of [concepts](@) (ideas), [relations](@) between them, and constraints, such that together they form a coherent and consistent whole. They have been crafted so that they may serve as a basis for architecting, designing, and implementing IT processes, It components and their [governance](@)- and [management](@) processes.

A good description - which would include a formalized model - allows us to explain to others how [concepts](@) and [relations](@) work together and can be used in practice, in such a way that such others can demonstrate that they understand all that. [Curated texts](@) of type `pattern` intend to provide such descriptions. Also, they specify a default name ([term](@)) by which the [pattern](@) can be refered to.

:::info Editor's note
header fields for `pattern` termtypes need to be discussed.
