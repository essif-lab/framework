**[Curated texts](@)** are texts that document terminological artifacts within a specific [scope](@), and hence are [curated](@) by a particular [terms community](@). A [curated text](@) typically documents characteristics of [terms](@), such as its [definition](@), the purpose(s) that it serves, etc. Also, it may provide examples, describe situations for which it is particularly relevant, etc.

A [curated text](@) can be of various types: it can document a [concept](@), a [mental model](@) etc. The kinds of contents documented in the text may differ, depending on such types.

A [curated text](@) resides in a file which we call a **[curated file](@)**. All [curated files](@) of a [scope](@) are expected to live in its [scope directory](@), as specified in the [scope's](@) administration file [SAF](@). They are not only expected to be processable using the [terminology tools](tev2-toolbox), but also by third party tools of the [curator's](@) choice, such as [Docusaurus v2](https://docusaurus.io/docs), or [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The third party tools that are used are also specified in the [scope's](@) [SAF](@).

A [curated text](@) consists of two parts: a **[header](@)**, and a **[body](@)**. The [header](@) is a set of key-value pairs that contain meta data about the [curated text](@) and/or data that could also have been part of the [body](@), but is so small that it doesn't warrant to have a dedicated section for it. Here is an example

~~~ yaml
---
id: "concept-curate"
title: "Curation of a Terminology"
termtype: "concept"
termid: "curate"
grouptags: "tev2", "management"
---

The header stats with three dashes `---` at the top of the file. Then, there is a sequence of key-value pairs, which is terminated again with three dashes. The body (this text) starts thereafter, and is regular markdown.
~~~

For further specifications, see
- [specifications for headers](tev2-spec-ctext-header), and
- [specifications for the body](tev2-spec-ctext-body)).
