:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

:::note Editor's note:
Text needs to be drafted to work out the idea that LaTeX is a raw text that can be highly configured. For starters, it would be helpful if LaTeX authors could
- specify [term refs](@) in their documents, and
- specify a location where a [glossary](@) could be inserted.

This hasn't been worked out. We may need to specify one or two [LaTeX Macros](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Macros), and some specific plugins for the [TRRT](@) and [HRGT](@) may need to be created.
