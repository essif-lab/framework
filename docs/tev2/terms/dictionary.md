:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary

A Dictionary is an alphabetically sorted list of [terms](@) with explanations. Each term may have multiple such explanations, which come from different [scopes/contexts](scope@).

The [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology@) provides an overview of how this [concept](@) fits in with related [concepts](@).

### Purpose

A dictionary helps people to get introduced in the domain for which the dictionary is created. Usually, this is a larger domain e.g. of some language, or about computer security.

### Criteria
an alphabetical list of words or phrases with possibly multiple, short explanations, that exists for the purpose of helping people to find out what a word may mean in various [scopes/contexts](@).

### Examples
Examples include the [NIST Computer Security Resource Center](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary), [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/).
