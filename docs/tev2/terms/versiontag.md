:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

### Summary
A **Versiontag** is a [tag](@) that is used to [identify](@) a specific version of a [terminology](@) from within a specific [scope](@). It may have various forms, and would typically be chosen such that it comes in handy with the tools that the [terms community](@) has decided to use to curate that [scope](@).

### Criteria
A **Versiontag** (of/within a [scope](@)) is a [tag](@) that is used within that [scope](@) to [identify](@) a specific version of that [scope's](@) [terminology](@). The alphanumeric string satisfies the regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`.

### Examples
Examples of scopetags are `essif-lab`, `essiflab`, `toip`, or `ctwg`
