:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **terminology** is the set of [terms](@) that are used within a single [scope](@) to refer to a single [definition](@), enabling [parties](@) to reason and communicate ideas they have about one or more specific topics. The [definition](@) that a [term](@) refers to may be defined in the same, or any other [scope](@). Further details can be obtained from the [terminology pattern](@).

A terminology may be viewed as a topic-specific subset of the scope's [vocabulary](@).

A terminology may conveniently be documented in (rendered by) a [glossary](@).

### Purpose
In order for [parties](@) to properly reason and/or communicate ideas ([concepts](@)) about some topic - in particular when it is a specialist topic - they have to establish a set of terms, the meaning of which should be [defined](@) in such a way that the likelihood of misunderstandings between them is minimized: a `**terminology**`

### Criteria
A **terminology** is a set of [terms](@) that are used within some [scope](@) by [parties](@) to reason and communicate about some specific topic(s) for the purpose of reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings.

### Examples
- The set of words listed in the [eSSIF-Lab glossary](../essifLab-glossary) are used within the eSSIF-Lab community for reasoning and communicating about topics that serve the [eSSIF-Lab Objectives](../essifLab-objectives), which is part of the `eSSIF-Lab terminology`.
- The set of words listed in the [Sovrin glossary](https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/) are used within the Sovrin Governance Framework and its Controlled Documents to understand the meaning of the terms that the authors intended to convey. Thus they comprise the `Sovrin terminology`.
