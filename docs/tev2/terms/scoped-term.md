:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **scoped term** is a [term](@), the meaning of which is determined by the [definition](@) to which it refers in a specific [scope](@)/context. Thus, a scoped term has a precise, well defined meaning. One can say that a scoped term is a [term](@) that is disambiguated.

The [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose
A [term](@) can have many different meanings, depending on the [scope](@)/context within which it is being used. It is useful to be able to distinguish between words/phrases without taking [scope](@)/context into account (for which we use the word [term](@)), and words/phrases that are part of a specific [scope](@)/context (for which we use the phrase [scoped term](@))
