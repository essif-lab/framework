:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **Scopetag** is a [tag](@) that is used to [identify](@) [scopes](@), e.g. in [term refs](@).

Scopetags [identify](@) a [scope](@) (from within a given [scope](@)), and hence can be used (within that given [scope](@)) to disambiguate [terms](@).

Within its [scope](@) a scopetag may also be used as a [grouptag], in which case it represents all [terminological artifacts](@) within that [scope](@).

### Criteria
A **Scopetag** (of/within a [scope](@)) is a [tag](@) that is used within that [scope](@) to [identify](@) itself or other [scopes](@). It satisfies the regex `[a-z0-9_-]+`.

### Examples
Examples of scopetags are `essif-lab`, `essiflab`, `toip`, or `ctwg`.
