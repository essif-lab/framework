:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

## Summary

A [curated text](@) is a text that consists of a ([yaml](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/)) text called a [header](@), which is then followed by another text called the [body](@). The [body](@) is 'raw' (ASCII) text that may employ a conventions for structuring it, e.g. those of [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), or [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/usrguide.pdf).

[Bodies](@) are processable by the particular tools that have been chosen by the [curators](@) for rendering their contents. For example, a [body](@) that contains [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is not going to be processable by LaTeX tools, and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/usrguide.pdf) are not proceed by tools that expect Markdown.

[Bodies](@) may have different structures, depending on the kind of [terminological artifact](@) that is being documented. For [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) [bodies](@), there is some guidance for [`concept`-type](ctext-concept#header) and[`pattern`-type](ctext-pattern#header) texts.

## Purpose

[Bodies](@) contain a variety of texts that are intended to help people fulfill their particular needs in understanding what the [terminological artifact](@) that it describes.

## Criteria

A [body](@) contains various sections, each of which intends to explain one (or more related) facet(s) of the [terminological artifact](@) that is described by the [curated text](@) of which the [body](@) is a part. At a minimum, there should be a summary (that gives readers a rough idea what it is about, and what it isn't about), and a purpose (that describes the benefits of having it around). For specific kinds of [terminological artifacts](@), specific sections may be required.

## Example

Many examples (of varying quality) can be found in the [curated files](@) of the various [scopes](@) that are around.
