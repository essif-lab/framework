# Term Ref

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

### Summary
A **Term Identifier** is an [identifier](@) that is used to [identify](@) (a specific trait of) a [term](@) that is [defined](@) in a particular [terminology](@).

A [term identifier](@) is typically used to [identify](@) the [scoped term](@) to which a [term ref](@) refers.

The syntax(es) used for [term identifiers](@) are specified as part of the [term ref syntax](/docs/tev2/spec-syntax/term-ref-syntax).

### Purpose
[Term identifiers](@) enable [authors](@) to unambiguously refer to any [scoped term](@), regardless of the [scope](@) in which it is [defined](@).
