:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **terms-community** is a [community](@) that maintains a [terminology](@) for the purpose of its members to avoid misunderstandings in their collaborations. They do so by:
- [defining](@) a set of [terms](@) that are specific to them, and that are relevant for its members to interact as they seek to realize their individual [objectives](@).
- determining which [terms](@) they will be using within their [community](@) in the meaning as [defined](@) by others.

Note that a terms-community (whose [objectives](@) are limited to maintaining a [terminology](@)) would typically be a part of a larger [community](@) with other (additional) [objectives](@), and the [terminology](@) that is being maintained might well be devised to serve the realization of these [objectives](@).

A terms-community would typically create and (automatically) publish a [glossary](@) that contains all terms that it curates, i.e. both defined by themselves as by others. Such a document then serves as the authoritative register for terminology within the [scope](@) of the (larger) [community](@) as it seeks to realize its community-[objectives](@). Also, this [glossary](@) is useful for non-members, as they will be enabled to understand what is being communicated within, or from that [community](@).

Further details can be found in the [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology@).

### Purpose
The purpose of establishing and maintaining a [terminology](@), and hence for having a [terms-community](@), is to ensure that any communications between its members is understood in the same meaning as it was said/written, which is prerequisite for reasoning, arguing, and making collective decisions. After all, as Confucius said: "The whole end o f speech is to be understood."

### Criterion
a [community](@) that maintains a [terminology](@) for the purpose of its members to avoid misunderstandings in their collaborations.

## Example

* The [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org)'s [Governance Stack Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group) is the terms community developing [terminology](@) specific to the [scope](@) of the ToIP governance stack.
* The [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org)'s [Concepts and Terminology Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700) is the terms community that develops the terminology-related [terminology](@).

## Notes

- The set of parties that form one terms-community can also form a different terms-community for the realization of other [objectives](@). For example, the members of the [ToIP CTWG](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700) have one set of [objectives](@) related to the [definition](@) and curation of terminology-related [terms](@), procedures for creating good [definitions](@) etc. That same group of [parties](@) might also serve the purposes of [identifying](@) [terms](@) that are commonly used throughout ToIP, and ensuring that these [terms](@) are properly defined and curated. This set of [parties](@) will thus form multiple [terms-communities](@).
