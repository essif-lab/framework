# Synonym

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.
:::

## Summary
A **synonym** is a [term](@) that has the same (or similar) meaning as another [term](@) (of which it is the [synonym](@)).

While from a theoretical point of view a [term](@) and its [synonyms](@) are identical, in practice they are more 'equivalent', i.e. while they have the same meaning, when using one or the other in a sentence, there is often one term that is preferred over the other.

[TEv2](@) does not assume that if a [term](@) is a [synonym](@) of another [term](@), this other [term](@) is also a [synonym](@) of the first. This allows for treating a [term](@) that is a [synonym](@) in other ways than [terms](@) that are not. This allows, e.g., to create [HRG entries](@) for [synonyms](@) that simply refer to the [term](@) that they are a synonym of, rather than repeating the description of such a [term](@).

## Purpose
Within the context of [TEv2](@), the [defining](@) [synonyms](@) for a [term](@) is needed so that [HRGs](@) can be made better readable without taking away control over the structure of an [HRG](@) entry
