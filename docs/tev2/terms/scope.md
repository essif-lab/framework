:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **scope** (in the eSSIFLab context) is the extent of the area or subject matter (as in [OED](https://www.lexico.com/definition/scope). We use it, e.g., to define patterns, concepts, terms and glossaries in, but a scope may serve other (additional) purposes. Scopes may overlap, or be nested. It is comparable to [Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace), were it not that entities other than names (signs that are used to identify/refer to objects of various kinds) can reside in a scope as it is defined here.

The [terminology pattern](@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose
This allows each [term](@) (words, phrases) to be used in a limited scope, for specific purposes. The fact that terms are 'scoped' implies that a term may have _different_ meanings, depending on the scope within which it is used. Also, it allows us to author documentation in a 'scoped' fashion, allowing different groups of people to author, use and disseminate their documentation (including documentation about their ideas ([patterns](@)), [concepts](@), and [terms](@).)

### Criteria
a (virtual) demarcation that serves particular purposes.

### Notes
- Scopes within which a certain [concept](@) is known, may still use different terms to refer to the concept. That's the reason for having [definitions](@) that specify criteria for determining whether or not something qualifies as (an instance of) some concept: we cannot rely on different scopes necessarily using the same terms for that.
