:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **glossary** is an alphabetically sorted list of [terms](@) with explanations, usually aimed to help people understand texts around a certain (set of) topic(s) in (at least) one context. A glossary may also be created for the purpose of being included in other glossaries (as a construction aid to such glossaries), or for still other purposes.

The [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose
A glossary may serve various purposes, the most important one of which would be to help people understand texts around a certain (set of) topic(s) in some context(s).

### Criteria
A **glossary** is an alphabetical list of words or phrases with (short) explanations, that exists for the purpose of helping people to get a first understanding of the meaning of each word in the scope/context for which the glossary is created.

### Examples
Examples include the [eSSIF-Lab Glossary](../essifLab-glossary), the [Sovrin Glossary](https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/), the [Glossary of Internet Terms](https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/glossary-internet-terms/), and glossaries for Legal Terms, e.g. of the [US](https://www.uscourts.gov/glossary), [Singapore](https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/services/self-help-services/glossary-of-terms), the [UK](https://www.copfs.gov.uk/involved-in-a-case/glossary-of-legal-terms).
