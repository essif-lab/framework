## Summary

A **[curated text](@)** is a text that describes a [terminological artifact](@) (e.g., a [concept](@), [pattern](@), or such) of a specific [scope](@) in a format that is defined by the [curators](@) of that [scope](@).

Every [terminological artifact](@) is associated with a [term](@) that [identifies](@) the [artifact](terminological-artifact@) within its [scope](@), and that hence can be used to refer[^1] to the [artifact](terminological-artifact@) or specific attributes thereof, such as its [definition](@), the purpose(s) that it serves, etc.

[^1]: While this is true in most cases, it may happen that two [artifacts](terminological-artifact@) that are [curated](@) in the same [scope](@), yet are of different kinds, are associated with the same [term](@). For example, 'ownership' can be described as a [relation](@) and/or a [concept](@) (and/or a [mental model](@)). From the perspective of human readability, this is not expected to produce difficult problems, as humans can typically disambiguate such terms from the context in which they appear, or the (human readable) texts can  readily be adapted. However, from the machine readable perspective, such ambiguities can only be resolved by ensuring that every [artifact](terminological-artifact@) is associated with an `id` that the TEv2 tools can use to [identify](@) the (single) [artifact](terminological-artifact@) as it is intended, and requiring that authors use that `id` whenever needed. This `id` must be specified in the `id`-field of the [header](@) of a [curated text](@).

A [curated text](@) consists of a ([yaml](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/)) text called a [header](@), which is then followed by another text called the [body](@). The [header](@) which is also called the 'front matter' of the [curated text](@) contains meta data about the [curated text](@).[^1]

[^1]: This 'front matter' may also be used to contain data that *could* have been part of the [body](@), but for which it is more convenient to make it part of the 'front matter'.

The [body](@) is a 'raw' (ASCII) text that may employ a conventions for structuring it, e.g. those of [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), or [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/usrguide.pdf).

## Purpose

[Curated texts](@) are intended to be processable by a variety of tools, that are chosen by the [curators](@). Together, these tools not only enable the [curation](@) of the [scope's](@) [terminology](@), but also the generation of [glossaries](@), and a better handling of [terms] in documentation, whitepapers and the like.

The precise conditions that [headers](@) and [bodies](@) of [curated texts](@) must satisfy will differ across [scopes](@) as [curators](@) are autonomous in chosing their tools and ways of working. To support other participants of their [terms community](@) in making contributions, they will define an [ingestion process](@) for the [scope(s)](@) they [curate](@), enabling such participants to contribute in ways that are easy for them

## Criteria

A [curated text](@) is a text that consists of a ([yaml](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/)) [header](@) and a ('raw text') [body](@), that describes a [terminological artifact](@) (e.g., `concept`s, `pattern`s, and the like) of a specific [scope](@) in a format that is defined by the [curators](@) of that [scope](@). It resides in a [curated file](@), which live in (a subdirectory of) its [scope directory](@), as specified in the [scope's](@) [SAF](@).

## Notes

The intention of [Curated texts](@) is to document a [terminological artifact](@), which is something that has a place in the way of thinking within a [scope](@). Ways of working (e.g. installation procedures), reports on research to be published in papers, etc., are NOT thought of as part of the [scope's](@) [terminology](@), and hence should not be documented as a [curated text](@). Having said that, this is not a closed discussion; we can think of arguments to the opposite, so who knows...
