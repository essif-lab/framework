# Term Type

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **Term Type** is an [identifier](@) that is used to [identify](@) the particular *kind* of [knowledge artifact](@) that a [term name](@) represents. Examples include `concept`, `relation`, `pattern` (or `mental-model`).

The ability to specify a [term type](@) as part of a [term](@) mimicks the common practice of disambiguating semantically overloaded [term(name)s](term-name@).

The [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
The [term-ref](@) [syntax specification](/docs/tev2/spec-syntax/term-ref-syntax) specifies the syntax that [authors](@) should use as they want to use a specific [term](@) in their text.
