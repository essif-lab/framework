The Terminology Engine (v2) is a set of specifications and tools that caters for the creation and maintenance (i.e. [curation](@)) of [terminologies](@), as well as for its subsequent use in publications of different types (e.g. websites, whitepapers) and formats (e.g. html, LaTeX), as appropriate for different, individual [scopes](@).

- **[Design Principles](/docs/tev2/overview/tev2-design-principles)**. This perspective describes the main ideas behind the ways in which [TEv2](@) has been designed.
- **[Architecture](/docs/tev2/overview/tev2-architecture)**. This perspective provides an overview of the files, tools and how they interrelate.
