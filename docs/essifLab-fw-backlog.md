:::info Editor's note
*There is currently no guarantee that this backlog is complete.*
:::

The backlog of the eSSIF-Lab %%Framework|framework%% is a list of issues (concerns, topics) that still need to be addressed in the %%framework|framework%%. This seems a more user-friendly way than maintaining them as [github issues](https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/issues), which obviously is a valid way for people to contribute to the %%framework|framework%% as well.

- In 'the wild', the terms %%issuer|issuer%%, %%holder|holder%%, %%verifier|verifier%% and %%validator|validator%% are used in different ways:
   - as a %%party|party%%, that %%governs|governance%% issuing, holding, verification and validation activities;
   - as a %%role-name|role-name%%, which one can see as a functional component that is capable of executing the functionality associated with issuing, holding, verification and validation;
   - as an %%actor|actor%%, performing the %%role|role%% associated with the names 'issuer', 'holder', 'verifier' and 'validator'

- The relations between %%mandates|mandate%%, %%delegates|delegate%% and %%employment contracts|employment-contract%% need to be worked out.

   It is our intention to rework the %%framework|framework%% in such a way that we can use these terms in any of these ways.
