:::info Editor's note
*There is currently no guarantee that this backlog is complete.*
:::

The backlog of the eSSIF-Lab [Framework](@) is a list of issues (concerns, topics) that still need to be addressed in the [framework](@). This seems a more user-friendly way than maintaining them as [github issues](https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/issues), which obviously is a valid way for people to contribute to the [framework](@) as well.

- In 'the wild', the terms [issuer](@), [holder](@), [verifier](@) and [validator](@) are used in different ways:
   - as a [party](@), that [governs](governance@) issuing, holding, verification and validation activities;
   - as a [role-name](@), which one can see as a functional component that is capable of executing the functionality associated with issuing, holding, verification and validation;
   - as an [actor](@), performing the [role](@) associated with the names 'issuer', 'holder', 'verifier' and 'validator'

- The relations between [mandates](@), [delegates](@) and [employment contracts](employment-contract@) need to be worked out.

   It is our intention to rework the [framework](@) in such a way that we can use these terms in any of these ways.
