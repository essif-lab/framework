<!-- A pattern captures/describes a set of concepts, relations between them, and rules or constraints that (instances) thereof comply with. As such, it is a concise and possibly formal description of a coherent set of ideas, a mental model if you will, that can be used to facilitate one's thinking about/with these concepts.
Please fill in the placeholders in this file as follows:
- `<existing-scopeID>`: machine readable text that identifies the scope in which this pattern is defined;
- `<Existing Scope>`: human readable text that identifies the scope in which this pattern is defined;
- `<NewPatternID>`: machine readable text that identifies this pattern within <existing-scopeID>;
- `<New Pattern>`: human readable text that identifies this pattern within <Existing Scope>;
-->

### Purpose

### Introduction
<!-- Gently introduce the pattern, by referring to real-world situations and using colloquial terms, so that when someone has read the text, (s)he knows what it is about, and is ready to delve into the specifics of the pattern. -->

### Notations
