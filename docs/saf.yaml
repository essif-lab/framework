# The second section contains a mapping between scopetags that are used within the scope, and the associated scopedirs.
# This enables tools to find the [SAF](@) of these [scopes](@), and from there all other directories, files etc.
# that live within them, e.g. to use/import their data.
#
scopes:  #
- scopetags: # definition of (scope) tag(s) that are used within this scope to refer to a specific terminology
  - tev2

#
# The third section specifies the versions that are actively maintained by the curators.
# For each version, the set of terms is selected that constitute the terminology.
# See the Glossary Generation Tool (GGT) for details about the syntax and semantics.
