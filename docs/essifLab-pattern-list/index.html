<p>Within eSSIF-Lab, we maintain a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental models</a>, which we also call <a href="/framework/docs/terms/pattern" hovertext="Pattern (also: Mental Model): A description, both casual and formal, of a set of Concepts (ideas), relations between them, and constraints, that together form a coherent and consistent &#x27;viewpoint&#x27;, or &#x27;way of thinking&#x27; about a certain topic.">patterns</a>, which are descriptions, both casual and formal, of sets of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/concept" hovertext="Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;).">concepts</a> (ideas), relations between them, and constraints, that together form a coherent and consistent &#x27;viewpoint&#x27;, or &#x27;way of thinking&#x27; about a certain topic.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>  They have been crafted so that they may serve as a basis for architecting, designing, and implementing IT components and their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for.">governance</a> processes.
We stress that while they represent a specific way of looking at things, there are many more, and in the end, all that matters is the extent in which they are successfully used.</p>
<img alt="George E.P. Box: All models are wrong, but some are useful" src="/framework/images/essif-lab-all-models-are-wrong.png">
<p>One might think that everyone has their own mental models, and uses them to make decisions, make sense of the world, etc. Any mental model that helps a person cope in the world is ok. For example, the ancient Greeks had a mental model that said <a href="https://oxfordre.com/planetaryscience/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190647926.001.0001/acrefore-9780190647926-e-46#acrefore-9780190647926-e-46-div2-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the earth is at the center of the universe</a>, and the sun and planets somehow revolve around it. Further development of the model allowed them to compute planetary positions, which played a role in fortune telling and therefore was considered important. Doing this is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84310-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very complex</a>. In the 16th century, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Copernican-Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copernic revolutionized science</a> by stating that the sun, rather than the earth, was at the centre of the universe. It wasn&#x27;t like he changed the universe itself - he only changed the frame of reference, the perspective, i.e. the mental model that he used to look at, reason with, and explain the universe. Copernic showed in a dramatic way that changing one&#x27;s perspective can have very profound consequences.</p>
<p>Most changes of perspective do not have such large effects. If he had proposed to put Jupiter at the centre of the universe, or the moon, he would have ended up with different mental models, but the complexity of computing planetary positions would have remained equally complex. Changing ones point of reference to the sun, however, made things much easier: planetary trajectories could now be seen as simple ellipses, with the sun positioned at one of the focal points.</p>
<p>&#x27;Mental modeling&#x27; is the art (yes, as far as we know it&#x27;s not a science) of creating models that make things easy. It&#x27;s like &#x27;searching for the sun&#x27;. We have been mental modeling artisans for several years now, and we have come up with models that are stable, in the sense that we have been using them and have found them to be quite helpful. Also, we have slightly less mature models, that need to be used in practice to see how well they work. And we have some models that we are in the process of describing, which we present here as ongoing work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stable-models">Stable Models<a href="#stable-models" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stable Models" title="Direct link to Stable Models">​</a></h2>
<p>These are models that are mature (stable). They have been applied during several years in various circumstances, and have shown to be valid (when consistently and consequently applied). Therefore, they are proposed for widespread use (and further evaluation/validation).</p>
