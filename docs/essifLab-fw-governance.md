## Purpose
The [eSSIF-Lab functional architecture](essifLab-fw-func-arch) identifies and describes a variety of generic SSI functions (capabilities), such as %%holder|holder%%, %%verifier|verifier%%, %%issuer|issuer%%, %%wallet|wallet%%, and more. An %%actor|actor%% that can provide such (generic) capabilities can only _actually_ provide them for a %%party|party%% if it knows how to to comply with the %%rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance|policy%% of that %%party|party%%.

**Governance** is the process by which %%parties|party%% decide how to make decisions, how %%actors|actor%% that work on their behalf are to behave and operate, and ensure this guidance ends up in some document which we will call a %%policy|policy%%.

## Governance processes and Policies
Within the context of eSSIF-Lab, pretty much every function/capability that is defined also mentions a corresponding %%(digital) policy|policy%% that is the place where rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance (e.g. preferences) are expected to be specified for the correct functioning of a technical component that may provide such a capability.

The structure of these %%digital policies|policy%% depends on the design of the technical component, as different kinds of technical components that (still) implement the same capability may have limitations or additional features regarding that capability.

It is the intention of eSSIF-Lab, however, to at least state some minimal requirements for the policies of various functionalities.
