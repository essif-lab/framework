# Domain Expert (or Subject Matter Expert)

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Design is still under construction.<br/>
:::

## Summary
A **domain expert** or **subject matter expert** is a person that has expert [knowledge](@) about a specific topic (subject matter), or skills in a particular area (domain). Their knowledge and skills are instrumental, e.g., in the design and development of architectures, information or production processes, and in the specifications of systems, components or other artifacts.

A common assumption is that [domain experts](@) are capable of expressing the [knowledge](@) that they can prove they have. Under this assumption, it is logical to expect that [domain experts](@) are capable to author e.g., the specifications of an IT system that is complete, consistent, coherent, correct, clear and concise. As this assumption is actually a misconception[^1], such expectations inevitably lead to problems.[^2]

## Purpose
The purpose of having **domain experts** and **subject matter experts** make (or contribute to the creation of) certain artifacts, such as an architecture, an information or production process, the specifications of a system (component), etc., is that their knowledge and skills reduce the [risk](@) of the artifact not being fit-for-purpose.

## Criteria
A **domain expert** or **subject matter expert** is a person that has expert [knowledge](@) about a specific topic (subject matter), or skills in a particular area (domain).

## Notes

[^1]: People that are native speakers of a language, can usually demonstrate their knowledge of the specifications of that language (its grammar), by showing that they can (1) determine whether or not a sentence in that language is grammatically correct, (2) correct the sentences that were incorrect and (3) come up with (say) 5 alternatives for correcting an incorrect sentence, and picking out 'the most beautiful', or 'the best' one. However, when asked whether they could write down the specifications such that the result is consistent, coherent, complete, cogent, congruent - and other c-words that refer to characteristics that specifications are typically expected to have, they will say 'no'. Even worse: if they are presented a booklet that is about the grammar of their mother's tongue, and are asked to determine whether or not it specifies that grammar in a consistent, coherent, complete, etc. way, they will also decline.

[^2]: A (temporary) parliamentary committee in the Netherlands conducted research into government ICT projects (July 2012 - October 2014). It had to map out the achieved and missed social effects due to the lack of proper information provision in government ICT projects. They observed that in many cases, specifications did not meet the requirements of being complete, consistent, correct, etc., which is one of the causes that the government spent between 1-5 billion euro more than it would have needed to.
