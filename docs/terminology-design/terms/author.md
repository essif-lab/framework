## Short Description
An **Author** is a person that creates and maintains texts (documentation, whitepapers, specifications, standards, [curated texts](@), etc.), and while doing so ensures that every [term](@) that appears in the text and that is defined in the [context](scope@) of that text, is used in the meaning in which that [term](@) is defined.

Their primary task/responsibility within a [community](@) is to provide actual written content, without having to bother about the 'details' like layout, how it is all rendered (processed to produce human readable artifacts such as static websites, PDFs, whitepapers etc. [Authors](@) are provided the means to mark-up [terms](@) in their texts with a easy to type reference to its meaning ([definition](@)), the effect of which becomes apparent in the rendered artifacts created from that text. These effects, such as popups (in a static website) that show the [definition](@) of the [term](@) used, or an automatically generated [glossary](@) that can be used as an appendix in a paper, makes it easier for [readers](@) to understand what the [author](@) means to convey with the texts (s)he has written.

[Authors](@) may also identify any specific needs or mechanisms that help them do the aforementioned tasks, and communicate these needs to their [curators](@), or otherwise contribute to the further development of [TEv2](@) so that such needs and mechanisms may be supported.

## Purpose
For many (but not all) texts, it is important that the people that create and maintain texts make an effort to construct the text in such a way that the intended audience (their [readers](@)) can easily understand the message(s) they try to convey - in an unambiguous way. In the context of [TEv2](@), we use the term '[author](@)' for people that do this, and ensure that [terms](@) that are explicitly [defined](@) are used in their intended meaning.

## Notes

- The [Manual for Authoring](/docs/terminology-design/manuals/authoring) provides guidance for [authors](@) that want to become more experienced in writing high-quality texts.
