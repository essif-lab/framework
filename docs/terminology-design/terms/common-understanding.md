# Common Understanding

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Design is still under construction.<br/>

## Summary

A **common understanding** is the state of a [community](@) where every member has the same understanding about the meaning of
1. the [terms](@) used in the [community](@),
2. the relations between these [terms](@), and
3. any constraints/rules that apply.

The latter two items are crucial for a [common understanding](@); they are prerequisite for having coherent and consistent ways of thinking/reasoning (similar as being a [linguistic unity](@) is).

It is a common mistake to confuse the [concepts](@) called '[common understanding](@)' and '[linguistic unity](@)'.[^1] It takes an active commitment of members of the [community](@) to consistently (and correctly) use the [terms](@) from the [glossary](@), in their intended (and documented) meanings. that isn't easy to achieve.[^2]

[^1]: For example, the W3C Recommendation "[Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)" has a section on terminology, that says that [verification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verify) is "The evaluation of whether a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation is an authentic and timely statement of the issuer or presenter, respectively". Yet, the second (green) note in [Section 5.7 Evidence](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#evidence) says "This driver's license was used in the issuance process to verify that "Example University" ***verified the subject***". According to the definition, verification is not about subjects. But even if subjects could be verified, it is hard to fathom that this would imply that a subject is a statement, or that it could be evaluated of whether (or not) it is an authentic and timely statement.

[^2]: In the Github [repository](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model) where the W3C Recommendation "[Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1 (VCDM)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)" is being developed, it is relatively easy to find issues in which contributors express themselves using terms that are defined in the VCDM, but in another meaning. A notorious example is the phrase "subject of a (verifiable) credential". Issues such as [#226](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/226) used this phrase, and [an issue (#464)](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/464) was raised, resulting in appropriate changes in the VCDM. Nevertheless, the practice continued, e.g. in the title of [issue #792](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/792), in a comment on [issue #875](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/875#issuecomment-1125039624), resulting in raising [issue #957](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/957), which calls for more clarification of the VCDM texts.

A [community](@) that wants to obtain/maintain a [common understanding](@) should have ways to test whether or not this is the case.

:::info Editor's note
We need to say that this is what 'terminology design' is about, and point to the methods for testing this.

## Purpose

Having a [common understanding](@) is one of the prerequisites of efficiently and effectively working together.

## Criteria

A **common understanding** the state of a [community](@) where every member has the same understanding about the meaning of (a) the [terms](@) used in the [community](@), (b) the relations between these [terms](@), and (c) any constraints/rules that apply.
