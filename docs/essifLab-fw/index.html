Each &#x27;Component&#x27; in this layer implements a specific technology, and any implementation of any of the WHIV components may choose which of these to use. Of course, if one of the WHIV components implements a technology, it would seem that the others would need to do so, too.</p><p>Technologies may come as a (proprietary or open source) library, as a service (offered by one or more <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

Then, it continues with requesting data to fill in the form (and providing data as requested by the other Party). It starts this by providing a web page that includes the form to be filled in, as well as a deep-link, QR-code or something similar that allows the requester&#x27;s browser (plug-in) or SSI-app to contact the provider-endpoint and set up a secure <a hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another." href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel">communication channel</a> through which both can communicate electronically. From then on there are two channels between the requester and the provider: one is a traditional (manual) web-browser - web-server channel, the other is one within which the <a hovertext="SSI-Agent: a Digital Agent that provides one or more of the SSI functionalities (Issuer, Holder, Verifier, Wallet) to its Principal." href="/framework/docs/terms/ssi-agent">SSI-Agents</a> of various <a hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

For example, a web-shop can then ask for a (delivery) address <a hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party." href="/framework/docs/terms/credential">credential</a>, and the customer can ask for a <a hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party." href="/framework/docs/terms/credential">credential</a> issued e.g. by the chamber of commerce that the web-shop is a legitimate company (and not some maffia website).<a href="#fnref-dc.1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></li><li id="fn-dc.2">It may well be that this functionality can somehow be split off in the (near) future.<a href="#fnref-dc.2" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></li><li id="fn-dc.3">For high-value <a hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)." href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction">transactions</a>, verification proofs are more important than for low-value <a hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction)." href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction">transactions</a>.
