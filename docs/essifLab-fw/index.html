<p>Realizing the <a href="/framework/docs/essifLab-vision">eSSIF-Lab vision</a> is the main purpose of <a href="/framework/docs/essifLab">eSSIF-Lab</a>. This is quite a challenge, because of the different kinds of complexity involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#x27;horizontal&#x27; complexity, e.g. interop issues at the technical, semantical, process and business levels.</li>
<li>&#x27;vertical&#x27; complexity, e.g. coherence and consistency between business policies, its processes, the data/information used therein, and the technology that makes it work.</li>
<li>&#x27;ecosystem&#x27; complexity, e.g. creating and maintaining agreements about technical and semantical interop, ways of working (e.g. to ensure the quality of data), etc., within an &#x27;<a href="/framework/docs/terms/ecosystem" hovertext="Ecosystem: a set of at least two (autonomous) Parties (its &#x27;members&#x27;) whose individual work complements that of other members, and is of benefit to the set as a whole.">ecosystem</a>&#x27; or a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/community" hovertext="Community: a Party, consisting of at least two different Parties (the members of the Community) that seek to collaborate with each other so that each of them can achieve its individual Objectives more efficiently and/or effectively.">community</a> context.</li>
</ul>
<p>To come to grips with such complexity, the eSSIF-Lab <a href="/framework/docs/terms/framework" hovertext="Framework (Conceptual): A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality.">Framework</a> aims to establish a varied set of articles/documents, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/terminology" hovertext="Terminology (in/of a Scope): the set of terms that are used within a single Scope to refer to a single Definition, enabling Parties to reason and communicate ideas they have about one or more specific topics.">terminology</a>, and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/pattern" hovertext="Pattern (also: Mental Model): A description, both casual and formal, of a set of Concepts (ideas), relations between them, and constraints, that together form a coherent and consistent &#x27;viewpoint&#x27;, or &#x27;way of thinking&#x27; about a certain topic.">mental models</a> that individual <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p>In order to enable <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">interactions</a> between different <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a>, as described in the <a href="/framework/docs/essifLab-vision">eSSIF-Lab vision</a>, eSSIF-Lab focuses on the exchange and administration of relevant <a href="/framework/docs/terms/data" hovertext="Data: something (tangible) that can be used to communicate a meaning (which is intangible/information).">data</a>, with a particular focus on the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/qualified-data" hovertext="Qualified Data: data that comes with assurances, at least regarding its provenance and integrity (immutability), that make this data valid to be used for specific purposes of individual Parties.">qualifications</a> and other assurances that are provided and/or needed. This makes its results particularly relevant for administrative organizations such as governmental bodies, financial institutions and the like. However, <em>every</em> party will have use-cases in which it needs to (digitally) interact with other parties, so for them, the eSSIF-Lab work is relevant as well.</p>
<p>A party usually cannot realize its objectives on its own. To do this, the party needs to get itself organized, e.g. by defining the kinds of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/action" hovertext="Action: something that is actually done (a &#x27;unit of work&#x27; that is executed) by a single Actor (on behalf of a given Party), as a single operation, in a specific context.">actions</a> that might help to further the objectives, purchasing/hiring <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actors</a> to do the work, managing the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/policy" hovertext="Policy: a (set of) rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance for the execution of one or more kinds of Actions, that Agents of the Party that Governs the policy have access to and can interpret such that this results in these Actions being executed as intended by that Party.">policies</a> that specify how such actors should operate (making the policies appropriately accessible and interpretable). We use the term <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for.">governance</a> to refer to the activities/process that gets a party organized. The governance activities that are in scope of eSSIF-Lab relate to specifying the work, and maintaining the associated artifacts, that is related to the needs of parties as they (digitally) interact with one another.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="23-business-transactions">2.3 Business Transactions<a href="#23-business-transactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.3 Business Transactions" title="Direct link to 2.3 Business Transactions">​</a></h3>
<p>In the eSSIF-Lab world view, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actors</a> interact with each other (as <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agents</a> for their <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principals</a>) to negotiate and execute <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transactions</a>. An agent uses the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/knowledge" hovertext="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.">knowledge</a> of its principal as its main guidance for such negotiations and execution. An agent may also use knowledge of other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> to fill in any gaps, or to provide additional details, as necessary. The <a href="/framework/docs/terms/pattern-party-actor-action" hovertext="The Parties, Actors and Actions pattern captures the foundational concepts and relations that we need for thinking about how things get done. It answers questions such as: &#x27;Who/what does things?&#x27;, &#x27;How are their actions being guided/controlled?&#x27;, &#x27;Who controls whom/what?&#x27;, &#x27;Who/what may be held accountable?&#x27;.">party-actor-action pattern</a> explains the concepts behind this.</p>
<p>The participants of a transaction are <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a>, that employ <a href="/framework/docs/terms/actor" hovertext="Actor: Entity that can act (do things/execute Actions), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.">actors</a> that do the associated work on their behalf. A party may employ different actors for executing different actions within a single transaction, each of which will use the knowledge of this party (its principal) to guide the execution of these actions, so that the entire transaction is performed according to how the party wants it to be done.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_%26_Engineering_Methodology_for_Organizations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>DEMO</em></a> transactions pattern (which is what we use) divides transactions in three phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>a negotiation phase, in which one or more agents of each <a href="/framework/docs/terms/participant" hovertext="Participant (in/of a Transaction): a Party is negotiating (or has negotiated) a Transaction Agreement.">participant</a> exchange data for the purpose of establishing a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction-agreement" hovertext="Transaction Agreement (for a specific Business Transaction): the set of rules that specify the rights (Expectations) and duties (Obligations) of Participants towards one another in the context of a specific Business Transaction.">contract</a> that specifies what the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> entails. This phase results either in a commitment decision of all participants, or the termination of the transaction because one of them quits.</li>
<li>an execution phase, in which (perhaps other) agents of the same principals work (execute actions) to fulfill the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/obligation" hovertext="Obligation (of a Party): an Objective that is Owned by that Party for producing a specific (set of) result(s) that are to be used (consumed) by that Party and/or other Parties.">obligations</a> of the agreement. This phase results in them stating that they have completed that work (or that they gave up).</li>
<li>the acceptance phase, in which one or more agents of each participant exchange data that leads to a decision to accept the results, or to escalate (e.g. start a lawsuit against the other participant)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the various phases of a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, each of its participants may need (one or more of its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agents</a>) to do the following:</p>

In short, an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-issuers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issuer</a> typically issues <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">verifiable credentials</a> to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holder</a>, which stores them securely under its own control. This accommodates point 5 (stating results).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Verifiers</a> typically request such credentials, perhaps better: a composition of data (called a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presentation</a>) that a holder constructs from different such credentials and subsequently sends back in response to such a request, which accommodates points 1 and 2. Then, the verifier will <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">verify</a> this response (accommodating point 3).</p>
<p>The fact that the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a> does not provide for a validator role, and explicitly places <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential-validation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">validation</a> of credentials out of its scope, illustrates that we need more than just <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">verifiable credentials</a> (VCs). Indeed, protocols are needed e.g. for issuing credentials, <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchanging presentations</a>, revoking credentials etc. Such protocols may provoke the need for additional <a href="/framework/docs/terms/role" hovertext="Role (of an Entity in some context): a defined set of characteristics that the Entity has in some context, such as responsibilities (Obligations) it may have, Actions (behaviors) it may execute, or pieces of Knowledge that it is expected to have in that context, which are referenced to by a specific (Role-)name.">roles</a>, e.g. a <code>revoker</code> (that would revoke credentials), a <code>policy provider</code>, etc.</p>
<p>In our <a href="/framework/docs/terms/framework" hovertext="Framework (Conceptual): A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality.">framework</a>, we postulate the existince of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/issuer" hovertext="Issuer (functional component): a component that implements the Capability to construct Credentials from data objects, according to the content of its Principal&#x27;s Issuer-Policy (specifically regarding the way in which the Credential is to be digitally signed), and pass it to the Wallet-component of its Principal allowing it to be issued.">issuers</a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/holder" hovertext="Holder (functional component): a component that implements the Capability to handle presentation requests from a Peer Agent, produce the requested data (a presentation) according to its Principal&#x27;s holder-policy, and send that in response to the request.">holders</a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/verifier" hovertext="Verifier (functional component): a component that implements the Capability to request Peer Agents to present (provide) data from credentials (of a specified kind, issued by specified Parties), and to verify such responses (check structure, signatures, dates), according to its Principal&#x27;s Verifier Policy.">verifiers</a> and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/validator" hovertext="Validator (functional component): a component that implements the Capability to determine whether or not (verified) data is valid to be used for some specific purpose(s).">validators</a>, which for our purposes we define as functional components (i.e. components that fit a functional architecture) and that can be readily realized as concrete technical components that can be deployed in run-time contexts to act as <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">digital agents</a> for arbitrary <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a>. It is not exactly the same, but nevertheless in line with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C VC Terminology</a>, which states (with the obvious exception of the validator) that they are roles that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-entities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entities</a> can or might perform as they execute some function(s).</p>
<p>As mentioned before, we expect that more functionalities and/or <a href="/framework/docs/terms/role" hovertext="Role (of an Entity in some context): a defined set of characteristics that the Entity has in some context, such as responsibilities (Obligations) it may have, Actions (behaviors) it may execute, or pieces of Knowledge that it is expected to have in that context, which are referenced to by a specific (Role-)name.">roles</a> are necessary to make it all work, e.g. that of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agent</a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner" hovertext="Owner (of an Entity): the role that a Party performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control that Entity.">owner</a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management" hovertext="Management: the act or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives.">manager</a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/governance" hovertext="Governance: the act or process of governing or overseeing the realization of (the results associated with) a set of Objectives by the Owner of these Objectives, in order to ensure they will be fit for the purposes that this Owner intends to use them for.">governor</a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/guardian" hovertext="Guardian: a Party that has been assigned rights and duties in a Guardianship Arrangement for the purpose of caring for and/or protecting/guarding/defending the Entity that is the Dependent in that Guardianship Arrangement.">guardian</a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/dependent" hovertext="Dependent (in a Guardianship Arrangement): an Entity for the caring for and/or protecting/guarding/defending of which a Guardianship Arrangement has been established.">dependent</a>, etc. The bulk of these roles will likely not be of technical nature, but more fitted to the higher architectural levels, e.g. of information architecture, process architecture, governance etc.</p>

<p>At the top of the figure are two business-related layers. Both are within the scope of the eSSIF-Lab project/architecture, yet they are outside the scope of the eSSIF-Lab infrastructure/architecture - that is because they are too business-specific.</p>
<p>The top layer (in the red rounded rectangle) has the functions of actual <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transactions</a>: it starts with a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction-form" hovertext="Transaction Form (for some kind of Business Transaction and some Party): the specification of the set of data that this Party needs to (a) commit to a (proposed) Business Transaction of that kind, (b) fulfill its duties/Obligations and (c) escalate if necessary.">transaction form</a>, the data of which is valid, consistent and complete, from which the (business) decision can be made whether or not to engage in a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, and that has everything necessary to actually execute that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>. The (administrative) results of such a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> are then stored in business data stores. We have put this layer in the eSSIF-Lab architecture for the single purpose of showing how the components of the bottom layer contribute to conduct <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transactions</a>.</p>
<p>The lower business layer contains two functional components, one for initiating <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transactions</a> and the other for stating <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> results (as per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_%26_Engineering_Methodology_for_Organizations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>DEMO</em></a> method), each of which with an associated business <a href="/framework/docs/terms/policy" hovertext="Policy: a (set of) rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance for the execution of one or more kinds of Actions, that Agents of the Party that Governs the policy have access to and can interpret such that this results in these Actions being executed as intended by that Party.">policy</a> that contains business-specific <a href="/framework/docs/terms/policy" hovertext="Policy: a (set of) rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance for the execution of one or more kinds of Actions, that Agents of the Party that Governs the policy have access to and can interpret such that this results in these Actions being executed as intended by that Party.">policies</a>.</p>
<p>The task of the Data Collector (or Data Collector) is to handle and initiate requests from/to <a href="/framework/docs/terms/peer-agent" hovertext="Peer Agent (of some other Agent in a Communication Session): the Agent with whom/which this other Agent is communicating in that Communication Session.">peer agents</a> to engage in some kind of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, by negotiating and exchanging data (through one or more, physical or electronic communication channels), and to produce a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> form whose contents are complete and valid, enabling an appropriate Colleague to decide whether or not to engage in the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>. Note that negotiating a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> has two parts: requesting a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/peer-agent" hovertext="Peer Agent (of some other Agent in a Communication Session): the Agent with whom/which this other Agent is communicating in that Communication Session.">peer agent</a> to provide data that its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a> needs, and providing data on behalf of its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a> that a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/peer-agent" hovertext="Peer Agent (of some other Agent in a Communication Session): the Agent with whom/which this other Agent is communicating in that Communication Session.">peer agent</a> requests. After all, a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">business transaction</a> can only start after all <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> have decided to commit, which they can only do after each of them has obtained the information it (subjectively) needs to do so. Also note that data that the data collector must ensure that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> context is properly maintained if it chooses to exchange data through different communication channels.</p>
<p>The task of the data discloser (or data discloser) is to state the (various, sometimes intermediary) results of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transactions</a>, by collecting data from the Business Data Stores, and creating a set of (related) statements/claims that can subsequently be issued to other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a>. Since such state-data may change, issuing data that supersedes an earlier state implies the revocation of such a state.</p>
<p>Note that both components are within scope of eSSIF-Lab architecture, but NOT in scope of the eSSIF-Lab infrastructure, as they are too business-specific.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="22--ssi-roles-layer-issuer-verifier-holder-and-wallet">2.2.  SSI Roles Layer (Issuer, Verifier, Holder and Wallet)<a href="#22--ssi-roles-layer-issuer-verifier-holder-and-wallet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.2.  SSI Roles Layer (Issuer, Verifier, Holder and Wallet)" title="Direct link to 2.2.  SSI Roles Layer (Issuer, Verifier, Holder and Wallet)">​</a></h3>
<p>The SSI Roles Layer contains functional components that provide the functionality associated with the well-known roles of issuer, holder, wallet and verifier. Technical components that provide such functionalities are part of the eSSIF-Lab (technical) infrastructure.</p>
<p>Apart from each having a specific task, as described below, implementations that are being deployed by one party should be aligned in that they support the same (sub)set(s) of SSI Protocols and Crypto features, as described in the following section.</p>
<p>The <strong>issuer</strong> functionality includes the issuing of what we will generically call &#x27;credentials&#x27;, i.e. sets of (related) statements/claims (e.g. as produced by the data discloser) that have metadata (e.g. date of issuing) and a digital signature by which third <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> can prove its provenance and integrity. Another function of the issuer is to handle revocation (and (un)suspension) of credentials that it has issued. For such tasks, it relies on functions that are made available by the SSI Protocols and Crypto Layer.</p>
<p>The <strong>wallet</strong> functionality includes the (secure) storage of credentials - both those that have been issued by the issuer (i.e. self-signed credentials) and those that have been obtained from issuers of other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a>. Another task of the wallet is to (securely) store (private) keys that can be used to sign or seal data on behalf of its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a>. Perhaps the most important task of the wallet is to ensure that credentials and keys can only become available to another component if they have the same (single) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a>, and will become available if such other component implements a functionality that needs it.</p>
<p>The <strong>verifier</strong> functionality is to support the data collector as it tries to acquire credentials from some other party for the purpose of negotiating a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">business transaction</a>.

SSI Protocols and Crypto Layer">​</a></h3>
<p>While represented as a layer, the SSI Protocols and Crypto Layer can be seen more as a set of libraries that can be used by wallet, holder, issuer and <a href="/framework/docs/terms/verifier" hovertext="Verifier (functional component): a component that implements the Capability to request Peer Agents to present (provide) data from credentials (of a specified kind, issued by specified Parties), and to verify such responses (check structure, signatures, dates), according to its Principal&#x27;s Verifier Policy.">verifier</a> (WHIV) components for the purpose of actually implementing some/all of the functionality that they need to provide. Each &#x27;Component&#x27; in this layer implements a specific technology, and any implementation of any of the WHIV components may choose which of these to use. Of course, if one of the WHIV components implements a technology, it would seem that the others would need to do so, too.</p>
<p>Technologies may come as a (proprietary or open source) library, as a service (offered by one or more <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a>), or both. There are way too many to mention here, but to give you an idea, here is a classification of such underlying/supporting technologies that seems to be useful. While we do mention some technologies explicitly, this should in no way be interpreted as that this would be necessary to support, or that others are not to be considered.</p>
<p>First, we have <strong>credential-related technologies</strong>, most often in the form of libraries, basically for the creation, (storing,) and verification of specific kinds of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credentials</a> such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Verifiable Credentials</em></a> (VCs), <a href="https://abc4trust.eu/index.php/pub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Attribute Based Credentials</em></a><sup>[ABC]</sup> (ABCs), <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-X.509-201210-S!!PDF-E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>X.509 Attribute Certificates</em></a>, <a href="https://openid.net/developers/specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>OIDC</em></a> tokens, etc. Various projects/implementations can already be used here, such as <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hyperledger Aries</em></a>, <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/irma-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IRMA</em></a>, <a href="https://opencerts.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>OpenCerts</em></a>, <a href="https://www.blockcerts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>BlockCerts</em></a>, and more.</p>
<p>Then, there are <strong>secure communications technologies</strong>, for the purposes of (a) ensuring that a technical component owned by a specific <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> can recognize that another component as one that it has had previous communications with and/or is owned by an identified <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a>, and (b) setting up a secure <a href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel" hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another.">communication channel</a>, i.e. one that guarantees message confidentiality (encryption) and integrity/authentication. A well-known way to do this is SSL, but new ones are being developed, such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>DID Comm(unication)</em></a>, that uses <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/draft-documents/peer-DID-method-spec-report.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>peer DIDs</em></a> (work in progress).</p>
<p>Another important category is that of <strong>crypto (related) technologies</strong>, which are used for various purposes, such as creating/verifying digital signatures, zero-knowledge-proofs, etc. Such technologies may come as a library (e.g. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-ursa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hyperledger/Ursa</em></a>), or as a service, e.g. an <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&amp;from=EN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>eIDAS</em></a><sup>[eIDAS]</sup> trust service.</p>
<p>We conclude for now by mentioning <strong>blockchain/distributed ledger technologies</strong>, for secure logging of (e.g. registration) events, where such logs have the property that it is virtually impossible to change the order and/or contents of the logged events, and that the logs are highly available to those that are authorized. Both public and private blockchains are known to be used, and different SSI-solutions may use them for different purposes, e.g. the registration of schema&#x27;s, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential-type" hovertext="Credential Type: the specification of the contents, properties, constraints etc. that Credentials of this type must have/comply with.">credential types</a>, DIDs and associated DID documents, revocation accumulators, etc. Examples include <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/ebsi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>EBSI</em></a> (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/blockchain-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>European Blockchain Partnership</em></a>), <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hyperledger Indy</em></a> (Alastria, Findy, Sovrin), Ethereum (<a href="https://opencerts.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>OpenCerts</em></a>, <a href="https://www.blockcerts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>BlockCerts</em></a>), bitcoin (<a href="https://www.blockcerts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>BlockCerts</em></a>) and many more.</p>
<p>It is expected that there are already some interfaces out there that may turn out to be useful here (e.g. (unverified) <a href="https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/7.4.0/eidas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>FIWARE</em></a>, CEF)</p>

<p>There are two interface layers in this architecture</p>
<p>The &#x27;<strong>ESSIF Glue</strong>&#x27; interface layer consists of a <a href="https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/tno-ssi-service/developer-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documented set of APIs</a> between the data collector and data discloser on the one hand, and the WHIV components on the other hand. The purpose of these APIs is to make calling the WHIV functions as simple as possible, given the functions of the data discloser and data collector. Ultimately, we would like to see these APIs standardized. Having such APIs allows different <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p>The <strong>SSI Tech APIs</strong> interface layer is the union of the interfaces of the components within it. Any standardization in there is outside the scope of eSSIF-Lab.</p>

<p>The purpose of the data collector is to produce (transaction-type specific) data structures or forms, each of which contains the necessary and sufficient data that allows (an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agent</a> of) its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a> to decide whether or not to engage in a (new) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> of the specified type.</p>
<p>Typically, the data collector would start a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> either</p>
<ul>
<li>when it receives a request from some <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agent</a> of another <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> for engaging in a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> of a specific kind.</li>
<li>when it is instructed by, or on behalf of its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a>, to request a specific kind of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> to some <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agent</a> of another <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

</ul>
<p>In either case, a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> form (object, context) has to be created that matches the kind of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, and a &#x27;<strong>transaction-id</strong>&#x27; must be generated that identifies this form/object/context. It will be used for binding incoming or outgoing messages to this <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, enabling communications to remain congruent, not only with the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agent</a> that requested the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, but also with other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agents</a> from the same <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a> and/or using different <a href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel" hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another.">communication channels</a>.</p>
<p>Handling/managing the various <a href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel" hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another.">communication channels</a> through which data can be exchanged is also a task of the Data Collector<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-dc.2" id="user-content-fnref-dc.2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. One reason for this is that negotiating a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> not only requires data to be acquired, but also to be provided to the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/peer-party" hovertext="Peer Party (of another Party that is a participant in a Business Transaction): a Party that also participates in that Business Transaction.">peer party</a>. Another reason is that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/peer-party" hovertext="Peer Party (of another Party that is a participant in a Business Transaction): a Party that also participates in that Business Transaction.">peer party</a> may use multiple <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agents</a> to provide such data, e.g. human <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">agents</a> (that might use web-browsers, social-media apps, phones, or physical visits), <a href="/framework/docs/terms/ssi-agent" hovertext="SSI-Agent: a Digital Agent that provides one or more of the SSI functionalities (Issuer, Holder, Verifier, Wallet) to its Principal.">SSI-agents</a> (that use the SSI infrastructure), or other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/agent" hovertext="Agent (of a Party): an Actor that is executing an Action on behalf of a Party (called the Principal of that Actor).">electronic agents</a> (e.g. services that can provide data when appropriate permissions are submitted - e.g. user consent tokens).</p>
<p>Thus, the data collector is generally considered capable of obtaining data through different <a href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel" hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another.">communication channels</a>. However, the technical tracks of eSSIF-Lab will exclusively focus on the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel" hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another.">communication channel</a> through which <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credentials</a> can be requested and obtained. Any extensions or business productization of data collector designs may be considered in the business tracks of eSSIF-Lab. The latter is not considered any further in this section.</p>
<p>In order to acquire data through SSI mechanisms for filling in a form for a specific kind of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, the data collector needs to know what kinds of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credentials</a> it should ask for, which <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p>The adjacent figure shows how a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> is conducted at the highest abstraction level. One <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a>, called the &#x27;Requester&#x27;, sends a request for a product or service to another <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> (that we will call the &#x27;Provider&#x27;). Then, they start to negotiate a &#x27;transaction agreement&#x27;, which means that they exchange data through various channels for the purpose of establishing the details of the product/service to be provided and the compensation, data needed to mitigate <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk" hovertext="Risk (of a Party&#x27;s Objective): the effects that uncertainty (i.e. a lack of information, understanding or knowledge of events, their consequences or likelihoods) can have on the intended realization of that Party&#x27;s Objective.">risks</a>, etc., all of which is necessary for the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> to (individually/subjectively) decide whether or not to commit to the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>. Section 3.2 provides more detail about this phase.</p>
<p>After commitment, the producer works to provide the product or service, and the requester arranges the compensation. This phase is entirely up to the business, and hence out of scope of this document.</p>
<p>When all is done, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> may issue a (signed) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/assertion" hovertext="Assertion: a declaration/statement, made by a specific Party, that something is the case.">statement</a> that specifies the results. Section 3.3. provides some more details about this phase.</p>
<p>In the example of the parking permit, a citizen (requester) sends a request to its municipality (provider) for obtaining a parking permit (the product/service). Then, the citizen fills in an online form (and uploads necessary PDFs) to enable the municipality to decide whether or not to produce the requested permit. The eSSIF-Lab architecture adds a secondary, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel" hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another.">electronic communication channel</a> that allows citizens to fill in the forms by using e.g. an SSI app on their phone. When the form is complete, the municipality decides whether or not to produce and issue the permit, which it can do as usual. It can also issue a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> that states the result of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, i.e. contains the details of the parking permit.</p>
<p>Please note that while <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transactions</a> are symmetrical in nature (i.e. both requester and provider need data from the other so as to decide whether or not to commit to the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>), there is an implicit asymmetry in that activities that <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> perform are ordered in time, which implies e.g. that the commitment decisions of both <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> cannot be done at the same time. Also, in practice, it often happens that a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> requires the other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> to have executed (and stated) its part of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> before it actually commits to the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>. For example, a provider may require the requester to have paid for the product before it is being shipped out. Consequently, the protocols for exchanging data/<a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credentials</a> will need to support such &#x27;asynchronous&#x27; ways of working.</p>

Transaction Negotiation Phase<a href="#52--transaction-negotiation-phase" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5.2.  Transaction Negotiation Phase" title="Direct link to 5.2.

<p>This phase starts by the requester sending a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction-request" hovertext="Transaction Request: a message, send by a requesting Party to a providing Party, that initiates the negotiation of a new Transaction Agreement between these Parties for the provisioning of a specific product or service.">transaction request</a> to the provider, and ends whenever either one of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

<p align="center"><img alt="High-level transaction negotiation" src="/framework/images/essif-lab-high-level-trx-negotiation.png"><i>Figure 4: High-level transaction negotiation.</i></p>
<p>This figure shows the high-level interactions during this phase. It starts by the requester sending a request for a product or service to the provider. Typically, this would lead to the provider presenting a (web) form the requester must fill in. In the eSSIF-Lab context, the form will also provide a means for setting up a SSI <a href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel" hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another.">communication channel</a>, i.e. a secure <a href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel" hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another.">communication channel</a> through which provider and requester can both request and obtain (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/presentation" hovertext="Presentation: a (signed) digital message that a Holder component may send to a Verifier component that contains data derived from one or more Verifiable Credentials (that (a Colleague component of) the Holder component has received from Issuer components of one or more Parties), as a response to a specific Presentation Request of a Verifier component.">presentations</a> of) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credentials</a>, the contents of which they can use to fill in the form. Then, after the form is &#x27;clean&#x27;, i.e. contains sufficient information for deciding whether or not to commit to the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, this phase ends.</p>
<p>Note that forms may contain fields that are required only in specific circumstances. It may only be possible to assess whether or not such circumstances apply after some (other) fields have been filled in. This means that the phase for requesting <a href="/framework/docs/terms/presentation" hovertext="Presentation: a (signed) digital message that a Holder component may send to a Verifier component that contains data derived from one or more Verifiable Credentials (that (a Colleague component of) the Holder component has received from Issuer components of one or more Parties), as a response to a specific Presentation Request of a Verifier component.">presentations</a> and responding to such requests may very well consist of multiple requests and associated responses.</p>
<p>In the example of the parking permit, the municipality might ask for a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> that proves the requester is a citizen that is a registered inhabitant of said municipality, a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> stating its residential address, a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> stating the make and license plate of the vehicle for which a parking permit is requested, etc. All this is subject to the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/policy" hovertext="Policy: a (set of) rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance for the execution of one or more kinds of Actions, that Agents of the Party that Governs the policy have access to and can interpret such that this results in these Actions being executed as intended by that Party.">policy</a> that the municipality has established for issuing such permits, and hence, it must be expected to differ between municipalities.</p>
<p>An example of conditionally required fields would be when the requester wants the municipality to customize the parking lot, e.g. because the requester has disabilities. Assessing such circumstances depends on the (optional) field where the requester must state any disabilities they have, and when that is the case, the requester may be asked to fill in fields such as whether or not a parking lot has to be customized (painted blue, with a sign stating that it is reserved for the provided license-place, or the kind of charging device if they have an electric vehicle).</p>
<p>Conversely, the citizen might request the (alleged) municipality to provide <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credentials</a>, e.g. to prove that it is actually an official municipality of the country it is part of. This would provide assurance to the citizen that it would actually be paying the fees to that municipality rather than to e.g. a rogue <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization" hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives.">organization</a> that might have spoofed the website of the municipality.</p>

<p>In the eSSIF-Lab context, we take &#x27;<a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a>&#x27; to mean any (set of coherent) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/assertion" hovertext="Assertion: a declaration/statement, made by a specific Party, that something is the case.">statement(s)</a> about any (one or more) <a href="/framework/docs/terms/subject" hovertext="Subject (of some coherent data set): the (single) Entity to which a coherent data set relates/pertains, such as attributes, Claims/Assertions, files/dossiers, (verifiable) credentials, Partial Identities, Employment Contracts, etc.">subject</a>(s) that a single <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

From this, it follows that any <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> can issue any kind of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> for any <a href="/framework/docs/terms/entity" hovertext="Entity: someone or something that is known to exist.">entity</a> that it knows to exist. A <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> does not need to be about a person or an <a href="/framework/docs/terms/organization" hovertext="Organization: a Party that is capable of setting Objectives and making sure these are realized by Actors that it has Onboarded and/or by (vetted) Parties that are committed to contribute to these Objectives.">organization</a>, but it can also refer to an order, a delivery, a seat-reservation, a prescription, etc.</p>
<p>We foresee two ways in which <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credentials</a> can be issued:</p>
<ol>
<li>both the requester and provider may issue <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credentials</a> to the other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> in the process flow that they are in. They can do so for the purpose of stating any (lack of) progress and/or results of the administrative process flow they are in.
In the example of the parking permit, the municipality may need some time to do some manual checks before it can issue the permit; in this case, it could issue a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> that states that the citizen has requested the parking permit and any other details that might be appropriate. Also, if it can issue the parking permit straight away, it can issue a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> that contains the details of that permit. The requester may issue a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> to the municipality stating the date/time and kind of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>, judgements or comments about the service that the municipality has provided.</li>
<li>any <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> may issue a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> upon request. Basically, this means that a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> (in the role of requester) issues a request to that other <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">party</a> (in the role of provider) asking for the particular <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a>. This is just another case of doing <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transactions</a>, that can be handled just as any other kind of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>.
In the example of the parking permit, when a citizen requests a permit, the provider might look for an existing permit prior to issuing a new one (it would have to do such a check during the process anyway), and depending on its business logic it would be providing the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> without further ado, or start the process of issuing a new one.</li>

<p>The requester starts the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> by pointing his web-browser to a web-page of the provider that (a) explains how to get a parking permit, and (b) provides a parking-permit application form that needs to be filled in. Technically, this means that the browser does a GET request to an endpoint that is serviced by the providers data collector component.</p>
<p>The data collector services this request by creating an empty form of a type appropriate for the request. Then, it continues with requesting data to fill in the form (and providing data as requested by the other Party). It starts this by providing a web page that includes the form to be filled in, as well as a deep-link, QR-code or something similar that allows the requester&#x27;s browser (plug-in) or SSI-app to contact the provider-endpoint and set up a secure <a href="/framework/docs/terms/communication-channel" hovertext="Communication Channel: a (digital or non-digital) means by which two Actors can exchange messages with one another.">communication channel</a> through which both can communicate electronically. From then on there are two channels between the requester and the provider: one is a traditional (manual) web-browser - web-server channel, the other is one within which the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/ssi-agent" hovertext="SSI-Agent: a Digital Agent that provides one or more of the SSI functionalities (Issuer, Holder, Verifier, Wallet) to its Principal.">SSI-Agents</a> of various <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner. Humans and Organizations are the typical examples.">parties</a> will be communicating.</p>
<p>It is a task of the data collector to orchestrate the inputs: different parts of the form may be filled in and subsequently changed in different ways. Some parts</p>
<ul>
<li>are required only after a certain condition is met (which is to be evaluated whenever the data that is entered into the form is changed)</li>
<li>must or may initially be filled in manually (i.e.: through the browser);</li>
<li>must or may initially be filled in with data from a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a>;</li>
<li>may be changed manually;</li>
<li>may be changed with data from a newly supplied <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This feature ensures that the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> is really two-way, and both <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party" hovertext="Party: an Entity that sets its Objectives, maintains its Knowledge, and uses that Knowledge to pursue its Objectives in an autonomous (sovereign) manner.

For example, a web-shop can then ask for a (delivery) address <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a>, and the customer can ask for a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> issued e.g. by the chamber of commerce that the web-shop is a legitimate company (and not some maffia website). <a href="#user-content-fnref-dc.1" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 1" class="data-footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

<p>It may well be that this functionality can somehow be split off in the (near) future. <a href="#user-content-fnref-dc.2" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 2" class="data-footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

<p>For high-value <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transactions</a>, verification proofs are more important than for low-value <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transactions</a>. This is to be decided by the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a> of the data collector. An example from the physical world: in order to obtain a visa for China, it is required that your passport (<a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a>) remains valid for 3 months after the end of your visit.

<li id="user-content-fn-dc.4">
<p>For example, a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/credential" hovertext="Credential: data, representing a set of Assertions (claims, statements), authored and signed by, or on behalf of, a specific Party.">credential</a> that contains an address uses a specific schema to specify addresses, e.g. the &#x27;PostalAddress&#x27; as defined by schema.org. This schema differs quite a bit from that of Dutch addresses as <a href="https://bag.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/def/bag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>defined</em></a> by the official (authentic) Dutch Registration of Addresses and Buildings (BAG). It may also well differ from the structure of addresses that databases of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/principal" hovertext="Principal (of an Actor): the Party for whom, or on behalf of whom, the Actor is executing an Action (this Actor is then called an Agent of that Party).">principal</a> have implemented.

<p>Inconsistent or incoherent data is necessary for various purposes. First, it allows for correct further processing of the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a>. A non-existent postal code, or one that doesn&#x27;t match the delivery address, may hinder a fluent <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> processing, resulting in additional costs and processing times. Another purpose is the early warning or detection of possible fraud/abuse. Remember that part of the data is being asked for reducing <a href="/framework/docs/terms/transaction" hovertext="Transaction: the exchange of goods, services, funds, or data between some Parties (called Participants of the Transaction).">transaction</a> <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk" hovertext="Risk (of a Party&#x27;s Objective): the effects that uncertainty (i.e. a lack of information, understanding or knowledge of events, their consequences or likelihoods) can have on the intended realization of that Party&#x27;s Objective.">risk</a>, and checking consistency/coherence of such data is part of the risk mitigation process. <a href="#user-content-fnref-dc.5" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 5" class="data-footnote-backref">↩</a></p>
