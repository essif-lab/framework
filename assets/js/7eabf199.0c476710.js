Specifically, data that fails particular verification tests can still be valid for some purpose. For example, a passport that has recently expired may still be valid to identify its bearer. The converse may also be true: data that satisfies timeliness tests, e.g. hasn't expired yet, may still not be valid for specific purposes.
