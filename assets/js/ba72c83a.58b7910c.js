However, others need to hallucinate as to what that ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"@"},"concept")," might be, and typically respond by thinking that the ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"@"},"concept")," that the ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"@"},"term")," refers to in their own ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"@"},"knowledge")," would be its intended meaning.
